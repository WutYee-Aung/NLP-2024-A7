       " Document(page_content='AIT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 :   17\\nAccording to the United Nations, the \\nSDGs are a roadmap for humanity, encompassing almost every aspect of human and planetary well-being and, if met, will provide a stable and prosperous life for every person and ensure the health of the planet. Reaching the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs presents both challenges and opportunities.\\nAsia is home to more than 60% of \\nthe world’s population. If it is to be prosperous, its future must be built upon sustainable and sound green principles. Like other universities and institutions playing essential roles in the SDGs, AIT is driving forward academic programs, research projects, and outreach activities designed to bolster sustainable development, sustainability, and environmental conservation around Asia and beyond. Recognized as one of the leading academic institutes in the field of sustainability in Asia, AIT has been collaborating with its partners to contribute its expertise to the sustainable development of the region over the past six decades. Under its five thematic areas: Climate Change; Smart Communities; Food – Energy – Water; Infrastructure; and Technology, Policy, and Society, AIT focuses on learning and research strategies that will drive poverty reduction, reduce risk and resource consumption, and create opportunities for green job creation by building sustainable livelihoods in Asia.The AIT Sustainability Report 2022 provides a summary of the range of activities undertaken at AIT during 2022 with a view to meeting the SDGs through its teaching, research, outreach and public engagement, and operations. AIT carries out a diverse range of activities across the Institute, and this report lists only some of many such initiatives. AIT strives to produce solutions and recommendations on climate change, water and food insecurity, air pollution, biodegradation, biodiversity loss, plastic pollution, and many others. The Institute continually strives to implement sustainability in all its core operations under its motto of Social Impact with Innovation, including by creating a platform to showcase its efforts toward achieving the SDGs in a comprehensive and detailed manner.\\nAIT maintains its position as a leader \\nin addressing the region’s sustainable development and social impact by meeting the SDGs. Despite the increasing number of competing universities, AIT has successfully retained its strong standing among the world’s academic institutions. Of 1,406 universities representing 106 countries and regions, AIT proudly held its overall ranking between 101-200. Moreover, AIT’s overall score increased to 82.5 this year. This accomplishment can be attributed to various collaborations with governments, NGOs, international organizations, impactful research projects, policies designed to support its diverse community, and the publication of its Sustainability Report.\\nAIT has been ranked highly for its \\ncontributions to the SDGs, with a global ranking of 43\\nrd for SDG1: No Poverty; \\n86th for SDG2: Zero Hunger; 68th (the top \\nranking in Thailand) for SDG10: Reduced Inequalities; and 72\\nnd (the top ranking \\nin Thailand) for SDG16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. This recognition highlights the extensive work done by AIT’s faculty and students across various fields of education and research.\\nAIT also aims to take the lead in \\npracticing and promoting sustainability by establishing an all-encompassing botanical garden on its campus. This initiative builds on previous campus plans and represents a significant leap forward toward making the entire AIT a fully-fledged botanical garden with a target to be Net Zero by 2030.\\nThe AIT Sustainability Report 2022 can \\nbe viewed at the following link on the AIT website: https://ait.ac.th/sustainability-reports', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Annual-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n",

My responsibilities under those standards are further \\ndescribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants including Independence Standards issued by the Federation of Accounting Professions (Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants) that is relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\nOther Information\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual \\nreport, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to me after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance conclusion \\nthereon. \\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it \\nbecomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nWhen I read the annual report, if I conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, I am required to communicate the matter \\nto the management and request that the correction be made.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with TFRS for NPAEs, \\nand for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern, \\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Annual-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='APPENDICES :   37\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements \\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with TSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with TSAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the \\naudit. I also: \\n z Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \\n z Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Institute’s internal control.\\n z Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. \\n z Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease to continue as a going concern. \\n z Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \\nI communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n(Yuvanuch Thepsongvaj) \\nCertified Public Accountant Registration No. 5371\\nKPMG Phoomchai Audit Ltd. \\nBangkok 28 April 2023\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Annual-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n",

They are prepared on the historical cost basis except as stated in the accounting policies.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with TFRS \\nfor NPAEs requires management to make judgements, esti-mates and assumptions that affect the application of the Insti-tute’s accounting policies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are rec-ognised prospectively.\\nTo ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on \\nthe use of the resources available to the Institute, the books of account of the Institute are maintained and classified for ac-counting and reporting purposes into funds, which are in ac-cordance with activities or objects specified. Within each fund group, fund balances which are restricted by outside sources are so indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted fund allocated to specific purposes by action of the governing board. The governing board retains full control of unrestricted funds to use in achieving institutional objectives. \\nThe purposes and objects of the funds are as follows:\\nUNRESTRICTED CURRENT FUND (FUND 10)\\nThis fund is the operating account of most of the academic and \\nadministrative units of the Institute.  It is available for general operating purposes without restrictions, such as might be im-posed by a grant agency or donor.\\nUNRESTRICTED FUND-GENERAL (FUND 21)\\nThis fund is the operating account of support units that offer academic-related services and certain administrative functions.\\nRESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND (FUND 22)\\nThe Endowment Fund is used where donors have stipulated, as a condition of their gift, either the principal is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity or used along with the income to meet the objectives of the endowment. \\nRESTRICTED PROGRAM FUND (FUND 30 AND FUND 31)\\nThe program fund includes academic and non-academic pro-grams.

The In-stitute has no title to these funds and the associated revenues and expenses have been excluded from the statement of reve-nues and expenses.  The assets held on behalf of these others have been disclosed in the statement of financial position to-gether with the associated liability for the same amount to these other parties.\\n3. Significant accounting policies\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied con-sistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.\\n(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION\\nThe financial statements of the Institute comprise the funds of \\nthe Institute and those of its branch to which it holds title. \\nThe Branch is an autonomous or semi-autonomous operating \\nentity within an organisation which does not have a separate legal identity. The Branch has separately identifiable assets, li-abilities, cash flows, revenues and expenses over which it has accountability.\\n(B) FOREIGN CURRENCIES TRANSACTIONS\\nTransactions in foreign currencies including non-monetary as-\\nsets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are trans-lated to Thai Baht at exchange rates at the dates of the trans-actions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the reporting date.\\nForeign branch\\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign branch are translated to Thai \\nBaht at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.\\nThe revenues and expenses of foreign branch are translated to \\nThai Baht at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates rul-ing at the dates of the transactions.\\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recog-\\nnised in the statement of revenues and expenses.\\n(C) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call depos-\\nits, fixed deposits which deposits type less than or equal to 3 months and highly liquid short-term investments.\\n(D) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES\\nAccounts receivable are stated at their invoice value less allow-\\nance for doubtful accounts.\\nReceivables from Program fund are unbilled receivables repre-\\nsented amount expected to be collected from donors.\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for inactive \\nstudents. Bad debts are written off when incurred.\\nBad debts recovered are recognised in other income in the \\nstatement of revenues and expenses.(E) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\nOwned assets\\nProperty and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and losses on decline in value.\\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the \\nacquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets in-cludes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condi-tion for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and remov-ing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software that is in-tegral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\\nDonated assets are stated at cost or reasonable market price as \\ndeemed cost. Subsequently they are stated at cost less accu-mulated depreciation.\\nWhen parts of an item of property and equipment have differ-\\nent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment. \\nAny gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and \\nequipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment, and are recognised net within other income in the statements of revenues and expenses.\\nSubsequent costs\\nThe cost of replacing a part of an item of property and equip-\\nment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Institute, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecog-nised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in the statements of revenues and expenses as incurred.\\nDepreciation\\nDepreciation is calculated based on the depreciable amount.  \\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets under construction, which is the cost of an asset, or other amount sub-stituted for cost, less its residual value. \\nDepreciation is charged to the statement of revenues and ex-\\npenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\\nCampus development 10 years\\nBuilding improvement 10 years\\nBuildings 40 years\\nFurniture and equipment 5, 10 years\\nTransportation equipment 8years\\nLibrary assets 6years\\n(F) LOSSES ON DECLINE IN VALUE\\nThe carrying amounts of the Institute’s assets are reviewed at \\neach reporting date to determine whether there is any indica-', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Annual-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

As a graduate schoolmost students of this instituteare involved in some form ofresearch. With the dynamicchanges of the present timessome paradigm shifts need tobe gradually incorporated intothe research culture in order toderive a greater fraction ofresources requiredto run aninstitute like ours from suchactivity.\\nIn year 2006 the Institute\\ncontinued to consolidate itsresearch activities, identifyingits strengths, experience in theregion and beyond, as well asto make plans for the future.After initial suggestions on somethematic knowledge areaswere made, there is an on-going brain storming exerciseto determine the niche areasand we plan to include themin the Institute StrategyDevelopment Plan. Theseresearch groups will have acritical mass of faculty andsufficient expertise in the regionto create a niche for ourselves.The Thematic Areas underconsideration are ICT forDevelopment, Bioresources,Urban and Rural sustainabilityincluding climate change,Asian Model of Management,Water and Robotic and SensorNetworks for IntelligentEnvironment (RSNIE). These arebeing discussed withdeveloping agencies, privatesector and other stakeholdersfor proposing appropriatesupport on their part and serveas inputs to the overall researchfund raising effort of theInstitute. With the support of thestake holders it is hoped thatthe laboratories and facilitieswill be further strengthened,modernized and diversified.It is evident that the research\\ncapacity and knowledgecreated by AIT researchactivities need to harnessed.With this in mind a multi-pronged strategy wasdeveloped, namely:\\n\\x84Protection of intellectual\\nproperty\\n\\x84Technology transfer and\\ndevelopment of pre-incubators\\n\\x84Development of\\nconsultancy services, etc.\\nThe newly formed Institute\\nIntellectual Property (IP)Committee reviewed andfurther developed policies tohelp protect potentialinnovative inventions, whicheither can be patented or belicensed directly to end users,who will convert the same towealth creation.  \\nIt also\\ncontributed towards thedevelopment of the IPinitiatives of the Institute\\n,\\nplayed an important role inraising the awareness ofthe capital value of IP for AIT,and worked on the legalaspects of licensing contractnegotiations. The Institute’s firstexperience in capitalizing theintellectual property in itsresearch as asset was througha patent license agreementbetween the institute and animportant US IP managementcompany. Under theagreement, the companyacquired the licenses forspecific invention disclosuresbased on the researchconducted at AIT’s School ofEngineering & Technology.  Theagreement will open furtherdevelopments in the field ofconverting research intointellectual property which willbe protected by patents.Further models of IP protectionare being considered. \\nThe\\ntransfer of technology on thebasis of research carried outhere at AIT is also beingpursued. The AIT consultancyservice which will make use ofthe technical expertiseavailable in order tocoordinate projects with theInstitute professionally is beingplanned.\\nA competition of the best\\nresearch theses among the AITgraduating students in May2006 was carried out to furtherpromote an atmosphere ofresearch in the institute, andacknowledge and showcaseoutstanding researchconducted by its students.  Ithas created an awareness ofthe type of work going on invarious fields in the institute,gave students confidence intheir research and presentationskills, exposed students to theappropriateness of their workthus paving the way toencourage excellence ingraduate scholarly researchand recognizing outstandingstudent accomplishments.\\nThere were seven competition\\ncategories, namely: Energyand Environment, Resources,Development, Information and\\nCommunications  Technologies,\\nIndustrial Systems &Engineering, Civil Engineeringand Management.  Thesespresentations were judgedaccording to the followingcriteria: relevance; originality;scientific/society contribution;general knowledge of the field;future potential for innovation;and presentation skills.  Thejudges were renownedscientists, faculty colleagues,industry practitioners, seniorofficials from internationalorganizations, government andacademe.

P.\\nSinghania Group from India.The spin off achieved fromthese competitions werestudent placements,scholarships for study abroad,internships for students fromsubsequent batches,sponsored projects and marketresearch, etc.\\nAdministrative Decision\\nMeetings in 2006 streamlinedprocedures and further actionsto rationalize and promotesponsored projects.  Schemeswere put in place for researchprojects sponsored bygovernment and developmentagencies, as well as for trainingprojects, conferences andpersonal consultancies.Decisions were also made onfaculty/staff time recovery fromsponsored projects while asystem of incentives was builtinto the system.\\nIn line with the plan toencourage continuouslystimulate active discussionsand debate amongcommunity members, anExtramural Lecture Series wasinitiated, and steps were takento revive the Institute’sProfessorial Lecture Series.  Thelecture series definitelyinstigated more fora for specialspeakers, and later, for thereporting of faculty research,and for the presentation ofdissertation research bydoctoral students.  These willencourage AIT doctoralstudents to developprofessional competencies atinteracting andcommunicating acrossdisciplines. Extramural speakersincluded Dr. Khunying PorntipRojanasunan, deputy directorof Thailand’s Central Institute ofForensic Science; Dr BrianAtwater, renown tsunamiexpert from the US GeologicalSurvey and author of “TheOrphan Tsunami of 1700”;UNESCO Directors Prof. Dr.Richard Meganck (Director/\\nRector of UNECSO – IHE, Delft,the Netherlands) and Prof. Dr.Hubert Gijzen (Director, Jakartaoffice, Indonesia) on “UNESCO-IHE and the potential forcollaboration with AIT” and“Windows of opportunities forUNESCO-AIT collaboration inthe Asian region”, respectively.                            \\nThe stress on collaborativeresearch and the initiativetaken by faculty from theinstitute has been continuingwith the year 2006 ending withabout 210 ongoing projectsvalued at about 1.2 billionbaht.

In developmentthere is a need fortechnologists, managers andsocial scientists to have goodchains of communication withthe local partners in order tobring real benefit to the enduser.  AIT, being a regionalinstitute with strong linkages inall these sectors in the region,is well poised to provide thecommon platform required forthis.

These properties createproblem in foundation andinfrastructure engineering such as lowbearing capacity, unstable slope,large settlement by consolidationwhen loaded and taking a long timeto achieve the primary consolidationsettlement.  In order to reduce thefuture settlement contributed by theprimary consolidation of thick layersof low permeability foundation soil,improvement in the soil drainagesystem is deemed necessary.  Thisresearch work studied the newinnovation technique to hasten theconsolidation rate of soft Bangkokclay by using the combination ofprefabricated vertical drain (PVD)and thermal method.  Both laboratoryand field works have been done.  Theresults show that raising the claytemperature up to 90\\noC increases its\\npermeability about 3 to 4 times.Therefore, this technique acceleratesthe rate of consolidation because thepermeability and the pore pressuresincrease with temperature.Moreover, elevated temperaturetend to increase the shear strength ofclays at drained condition.\\nDuration: January 2005 to March 2006\\nInvestigators: Prof Dennes T Bergado\\nDr Noppadol Phien-wej\\nSponsor: Royal Thai Government (RTG)\\nTotal Contracted Amount:   Baht 900,000\\n6.5 Ongoing / In\\nProgress Grant andSponsoredResearch\\nBridge-Development of HumanResources in Development ofAcademic Programmes inSustaintable GeosystemExploration and Engineering(BRIDGE)\\nProject Description :  Considering the\\ngrowing demand for an internationaltraining and education in geo-systemengineering and exploration in theMekong region countries, this 3-yearproject aims to help develop humanresources at Vietnam NationalUniversity (VNU) and National Universityof Laos (NUOL).

Sincemany work-pieces are produced byComputer Numerical Control Machine(CNC Machine), thus, work-piecesaccuracy depends directly onaccuracy of the CNC Machine.\\nActually, CNC machine is able\\nto produce work-piece accurately upto the level of 1 mm.  However, in reality,it is very difficult to control the machineat this level since the CNC machinealways includes the following inaccura-cies in the system; (1) inaccuracy inCNC machine assembly, especially withmovable components, (2) thermaldistortion of CNC machine and work-pieces during manufacturing, (3)inaccuracy induced by cutting forces,(4) cutting tool wear, (5) fixture errors,etc.  Inaccuracies from (1), (2), and (3)are the main factors of manufacturingerrors in CNC machines.\\nMostly, manufacturing error is\\ntime-variant (not constant with time), itdepends on many factors includingmachine condition, environmenttemperature, work-pieces material andweight, and so on at the instant ofoperation.\\nIn this research, the researchers\\nwill develop a systematic-error-compensate CNC controller.  Thedeveloped controller collects necessaryinformation; e.g., position and displace-ment, temperature, forces, etc., fromCNC machine and uses this informationin the error compensate algorithm tocompensate error in real time.  Outputfrom the error compensation is appliedto correct command to the CNCmachine.\\nDuration: 1-Jan-02 to 31-Dec-06\\nInvestigator :  Dr. Manukid Parnichkun\\nSponsor : Mitutoyo Association for Science\\nand TechnologyTotal Contracted Amount :  Baht 828,000\\nA Study of Development of an\\nIntelligent Vehicle Project\\nProject Description :  The project is to\\ndevelop an intelligent vehicle for use toimprove highway safety and fuelconsumption.

However thereare also some limitations of usingthese robots, for examples, difficultyin self decision making in an unknownenvironment, long time consuming inremote control operation whereoperator has to instruct the robot towork in detail for every step, difficultyof moving in an environmentobstructed by obstacles. From theabove reasons, if we are able tocontrol actions and motions ofanimals or small lives, the abovelimitations will disappear. The animalunder control will act as a robo-animal. The operator just sends a highlevel command to the robo-animal,and then lets the animal solve a lowlevel problem by itself, for examples,avoiding crashing with obstacles,stepping over the obstructed objects.There are plenty of potentialapplications of using robo-animal; forexamples in rescue, demining,agricultural pest control, surveillance,and searching purposes. Brain-machine interface concept will beapplied to control the robo-animal.An array of electrodes will beimplanted into the animal’s brain.Commands which are in the form ofelectrical signal will then be appliedto stimulate the animal’s brain.

Some patients might chooseto move to the expert hospitals butthey have to spend a lot of moneyand time.  It is too late for many times.Furthermore, in the case of heavyinfection patients, doctors cannotapproach the patients directly.

       " Document(page_content='Annual Report on Research 20068.1   Introduction\\n \\nGeoinformatics comprisingRemote Sensing (RS) ,\\nGeographic Information System(GIS)  and Global Positioning\\nSystem (GPS)  provides extremely\\nuseful tools for environmentaland natural resourcesmanagement.  They are widelyrecognized as supporting toolsfor the planning, monitoring, andmanagement of the appropriateutilization of resources at thecountry, regional and globallevels. While they representmultidisciplinary backgrounds,students in RS&GIS share acommon interest, that is, to useremote sensing, GIS, GPS andother space technologies astools in pursuing their academicwork as well as in developingnew technologies that areapplicable to the region.  Because of the complexity of thetechnologies together with theheavy dependence onadvanced computer skills,application specialists need tohave a sound knowledge of thetheoretical aspects andpractical approaches tointegrate many resources ofinformation that addressdifferent applications. Furthermore, scientists, plannersor engineers interested in thesetechnologies should be familiarwith past, present and futuresatellite systems, theirappropriate usage, dataacquisition and handling andintegration with other datasources. The curriculum well covers thetheoretical aspects andapplication of spacetechnology, especially inRemote Sensing and GIS.  Itprovides students ample time togain application know-howthrough laboratory sessions. Students are free to use satellitedata received by the NOAA,AVHRR and MODIS SatelliteReceiving Stations for their theses\\nor research studies. The demand for RS&GISgraduates is very high as there islack of professionals in thesedisciplines, particularly those witha vast knowledge of thepractical utilization of thesetechnologies.  Employmentopportunities are available in awide range of areas, includingagriculture, forestry, coastaldevelopment and management,urban planning anddevelopment, medicaltechnology, mapping andplanning, disaster mitigation andenvironmental management. Major areas covered in thecoursework are fundamentals ofremote sensing and GIS, earth-energy interaction, atmosphericcorrection, application potentialin various disciplines, GIS datasources, map projection, geo-statistics, spatial modeling,automated mapping, digitalterrain model, GPS dataacquisition, and integration ofGIS, remote sensing and GPS.\\n \\n 8.2     Research Facilities\\nand Laboratories\\nThe RS&GIS field of studyprovides excellent facilities forteaching, research and projectswhich consists of the DigitalImage Processing laboratory,Institute-wide GIS laboratory, Asiae-learning project experimentroom, meeting rooms, and theGeoinformatics Centerlaboratory.  The RS&GIS field ofstudy has a policy of maintainingthe best working environment forstudents, staff and faculty.  Apartfrom the Institute-providedaccess to the Internet andelectronic mail, each student ofthe RS&GIS field of study isallocated computer space forindividual use of about 1-2 Gb(extendible).  The space forpersonal web pages to behosted on RS&GIS network, canalso be provided upon request. The RS&GIS LAN Network can\\nalso be monitored in real time.\\n Besides, it has a very good\\narchive of over 600 scenes ofsatellite imagery of SPOT,Landsat-TM, NOAA, ADEOS, ERS-SAR, and JERS-SAR to serve thestudents in their research andthesis studies.  Other data, suchas topographic, landuse, soil,geology maps of Thailand andsome aerial photographs, arealso available.\\n The RS&GIS library also provides\\nstudents with more specializedbooks, journals, and computermanuals.\\n Some equipment in its\\nlaboratory available foracademic activities include:Trimble geoexplorer; Garmin GPSSeries III and V; laptop computer;digital camera; wireless hub/switch; wireless USB; networkswitch; network hub; black/whiteand color laser printers; A4 and\\nA0 scanners; table and personal\\nstereoscopes; and an LCDprojector.\\n \\n \\n8.3     Faculty and\\nResearch Staff\\n \\nThe Institute is deeply grateful that\\nHer Royal Highness Princess MahaChakri Sirindhorn  has seen fit\\nto share her expertise andexperience with faculty, staff andstudents, as an Honorary FacultyMember.

Naturalrubber is proposed as the primaryraw material because Thailand iscurrently the largest producer ofrubber in the world.  If the projectfinds a successful composite ofnatural rubber that fits for railwaysleepers, the country will benefit frombeing able to exploit the large stockof natural rubber she over- producesevery year.  This in turn will stabilizethe market price of natural rubber.Prototypes of railway sleepers will bemade from different composites ofnatural rubber, and will be testedbased on the functional requirementsof railway sleepers in cooperationwith the State Railway of Thailand.  Asrailway tracks can be installed byregular spikes as in the case ofwooden sleepers, Thailand will notneed to import special fasteners.  Inaddition, once the technology is wellproven, Thailand can export thistechnology oversea.\\nDuration: 16 May 2003 to December 2006\\nInvestigators: Prof  Worsak Kanok-\\nNukulchai, Dr Noppadol Phien-wej\\nSponsor: Royal Thai Government\\nTotal Contracted Amount ( Baht) 996,000\\nChemical Modification of Natural\\nRubber Composites forStructural Application\\nProject Description:   Natural rubber (NR) is\\nnaturally soft and highly deformableat room temperature. Aftercrosslinking (or vulcanization), rubberbecomes more elastic but stillpossesses low compressive modulus.From our pervious investigation,mechanical properties of NR weresignificantly enhanced by increasingcrosslinking density of NRvulcanizates, and by adjusting typesand amounts of reinforcing fillers. Itwas found that by increasingcrosslinking density of NRvulcanizates, the rubber productbecomes very stiff and inelastic,whereas, by adjusting the type andamount of reinforcing fillers at low tomoderate crosslinking density, thestiffness of the rubber is still lowcrosslinking density demandsexpensive chemicals and a large\\namount of reinforcing fillers toachieve desirable properties.\\nDuration: 30 Sept 2004 – 31 Dec 2006\\nInvestigator: Prof. Worsak Kanok-Nukulchai\\nSponsor: Royal Thai Government (RTG)\\nJoint Research Fund\\nTotal Contracted Amount   B 996,000.00\\nSeismic Behavior of Steel Beam-\\nColumn Connection with KneeBrace (Knee Braced Frame)\\nProject Description:   The research\\nproposed herein will involve anexperimental study of a new structuralsystem to resist seismic forces calledmoment frames with knee brace.

These key dynamicproperties are: natural periods,vibration mode shapes, and criticaldamping ratios.  Approximateempirical relations between naturalperiods and building height werederived by regression analyses.  Finite-element models of six (6) selectedbuildings were formulated, and theirdynamic properties were derived fromthe models and compared with thoseobtained from the ambient vibrationmeasurements.  A reasonably fairagreement was obtained.  The Sub-project 4 focused on the evaluation ofactual seismic capacity of typicalreinforced concrete (RC) buildings inBangkok, most of which were designedand constructed without anyconsideration on seismic loading.  Theresearch works were divided into twomain parts: (1) seismic performance ofcritical RC components and (2) seismiccapacity of the whole buildingstructures.  In the first part, seven RCcolumn specimens, four beam-columnsubassemblages, and one post-tensioned flat slab-column connectionwere tested under quasi-static cyclicloading to study their seismic behavior.In the second part, the seismiccapacity of the whole buildingstructures was determined by anonlinear pushover analysis procedurefollowing the guidelines of the ATC-40and FEMA-273 documents.  Six existingbuildings were selected to representtypical RC buildings in Bangkok.  Manymeasures to improve the seismicperformance of buildings were alsoinvestigated.   Among these, seismicdetailing of some critical members and\\nadding shear walls were found to bevery effective measures.\\nDuration: 1 Sept 2002 to 31 Dec 2006\\nInvestigator: Dr Pennung Warnitchai\\nCollaborators: Dr Noppadol Phienwej, AIT\\n      Dr. Nakhorn Poovarodom, Thammasat\\nUniv.\\n      Dr. Virote Boonyapinyo, Thammasat\\nUniv.\\n     Dr. Amorn Pimanmas,  Sirindhorn\\nInternational Institute of Technology\\n      Dr. Anat Ruangrassamee,\\nChulalongkorn Univ.\\n      Dr. Anek Sirpanichgorn, King\\nMongkut’s Univ. of Technology,Thonburi\\nSponsor: Thailand Research Fund\\nTotal Contracted Amou nt  Baht 3,154,000\\n9.4 Ongoing / In\\nProgress Grant andSponsoredResearch\\nReconstruction andDevelopment in the Tsunami-HitPhangnga Province\\nProject Description The project aims to\\ncontribute to the sustainablerehabilitation and development afterthe tsunami destruction in Thailandby designing, applying, evaluatingand disseminating appropriateinnovative technologies for energy-efficient housing and watermanagement.\\nInvestigator: Mr. Bernard Levebre\\nDuration: 1 Dec 2005 to 31 Dec 2008\\nSponsor:  EU-Asia Pro Eco IIB Post Tsunami\\nProgramme, European Commission\\nTotal Contracted Amount  (Baht) 3,021,700\\nTesting of Structural Integrity of\\nConcrete Structure for HopewellColumn (Hopewell 2005)\\nProject Description:   To study the structural\\nintegrity of Hopewell’s column and toobserve and identify the extent ofdeterioration or damage of concretestructure and to determine thestrength of concrete by using eithernon-destructive test for North BoundTrain System in a Bangkok (Bang sue-Rangsit) and Bang Sue Train Station.\\nDuration: August 2005 to March 2007\\nInvestigator: Dr Pichai Nimityongskul\\nSponsor: NTBR\\nTotal Contracted Amount   (Baht) 3,000,000\\nMix Design of RCC for Nam\\nNgum 3 Dam\\nProject Description: Mix design of Roller\\nCompacted Concrete (RCC) forNam Ngum 3 Dam\\nDuration Nov-06 to Sept-07\\nInvestigator:  Dr. Pichai Nimityongskul and\\nDr. Sun Sayamipuk\\nSponsors: MDX Lao Co.

Itoffers a balanced curriculum,covering both engineering andmanagement aspects of waterresources.  Students are trainedto acquire knowledge andhands-on practice in tools andtechniques to come up withviable and sustainable solutionswithin the framework of theintegrated water resourcesmanagement at the river basinscale.\\nThe WEM field of study covers\\nfive focal areas: Agricultural\\nWater , Coastal Water , Urban\\nWater , Water Resources , and\\nExtreme Events and RiskManagement .  The courses are\\ndesigned in such a way thatstudents can specializeaccording to their interests.Courses on WatershedHydrology, Hydrodynamics,Water Resources Systems, andConcepts in Water Modelingprovide the solid foundation tothe advanced courses.  Thecurriculum emphasizes tools andtechniques in water resourcesplanning and management.\\nAgricultural Water  courses impart\\nknowledge and skills necessaryfor the development andmanagement of water resourcesfor agriculture.  They addressvarious multi-disciplinary issues inthe planning, design,implementation, operation andmaintenance of irrigation anddrainage projects and land andwater conservation programs.Current researches in the areainclude irrigation and drainage\\nsystem management, croppingsystems, erosion and waterquality problems, soilconservation and land-use, andwatershed management.\\nThe management and design of\\nsound engineering works for thecontrol and effective use ofcoastal zones require in-depthknowledge of hydrodynamicsand the understanding ofcoastal zone phenomena.Coursework and research inCoastal Water cover studies ofwave characteristics and theiraction on beaches, coastalsedimentation, estuarinehydraulics and the appliedaspects of coastal zoneengineering and management.\\nUrban Water  courses relate to\\nwater supply and sanitation,storm water, and domesticwastewater and urban drainagefor sustainable management ofurban areas.  The research inrelation to urban water focuseson application of state-of-the-arttheory in water demandforecasting and management,design and management ofwater distribution systems inurban and rural areas, real-timehydrological information systemsfor urban flooding and drainage.\\nGiven the ever-growing\\nimportance of water quality, anintegrated water quantity-qualityapproach is essential.  Courses inWater Resources focus ontechniques to assess theoccurrence and availability ofsurface and groundwater.Students acquire a soundunderstanding of basic principlesin river engineering andmodeling, water resourcesplanning, conjunctive use ofsurface and groundwater;integrated water resourcesmanagement and social andenvironmental impactassessment of water resourcesprojects.  In-depth knowledgeand hands-on practice onmathematical modeling of waterresources systems is provided.Flooding is a natural\\nphenomenon and varioushuman activities as well asclimatic changes haveaggravated the problemcausing economic losses.Students are exposed to anunderstanding of the behavior ofrivers, and to design appropriatestructural and non-structuralalternatives for the effectivemanagement of rivers andwaterways.

The barriers to the useof biofuels are still substantial, as thereis no policy framework, financingmechanisms are not in place, theawareness in the transportation sectorof this clean technology is low, and thebest technologies are not alwaysavailable.  On the biomass supply side,the agricultural sector has a lengthyexperience with biomass production,and increasing the demand forbiofuels would have positive economicimplications for this sector.  Howeverthere are policy barriers to beovercome as well.  In order to meet theobjective mentioned above, thisproject aims to raise awareness anddevelop adequate capacity in Indiaand the neighbouring countries toincrease use of biofuels inorder toimprove local environmentalconditions and promote sustainableinvestment.

New computerscience and engineering solutionsare needed to simply handle theexponential growth in the trafficand bandwidth usage which isputting severe strain on theInternet today.   There is urgentneed for a new breed of engineersand technologists to respond tothe growing demand from thisrapid expansion with endlessrange of new applications.\\nAs the Internet continues to\\npenetrate every corner of societyand of the economy, there areother non-technical issues to beaddressed along with theadvancement of technologicalprogress.  There is a definite needfor better understanding of theInternet’s social, business,economic as well as legalimplications in order to promotethe standards of behaviour andpractices for the community thatare appropriate to continuedgrowth and beneficial use of theInternet.\\nSince Dcember 2003, AIT has set\\nup  the Internet Education andResearch Laboratory (intERLab), as  a multidisciplinary unit,  to focuson training people for designing,building and maintaining, andoperating Internet and on-lineeducational services, or for simplyusing the Internet as a major toolin their everyday life and work.   Tokeep up with the rapiddevelopment in the field, intERLabwill be organized as a laboratoryconcentrating on research inthree main directions: technical/engineering, e-learning andsocial/policy/business/legalaspects.\\nThe concept of establishing a fixed\\nlocation for the internet humanresources development has beendiscussed and endorsed byleading Asia-Pacific Internetorganizations at their AP* Retreat\\nmeeting at AIT in year 2000.Several leading researchinstitutions in Asia-Pacific. Europeand the US have indicated theirinterests in forming up a networkof support for intERLab research,training and education. The core component of thelaboratory will be on researchactivities. This will be achieved bymaintaining excellent researchfacilities and staff, hosting visitingresearchers and takingadvantage of linkages withresearch laboratories worldwide.The lab was built upon pre-existingInternetworking ResearchLaboratory of the School ofAdvanced Technologies and theDistributed Education Center.\\n27.2 Mission\\nTo be a center for humanresources development for topInternet specialists for the region.\\n27.3      Unit Governance\\nProf. Kanchana KanchanasutintERLab Director\\n27.4     Resources\\n- VClass royal free e-\\nlearning platform\\n- Custom courseware\\ndevelopment; E-learningconsultancy;instructional designconsultancy; Customcourse design\\n- VClass Trainings for AIT\\nFaculty and Staff\\n- VClass Hosting Service\\nand Technical Services\\n- Trainings for Network\\nInfrastructure Engineers(7~8 courses per year)\\n- Video Conferencing\\nservices\\n- Secretariats for AP*\\nRetreat and APNGorganizations27.5 Research Staff\\nProf. Kanchana Kanchanasut        Professor of Computer\\nScience, School ofEngineering and Technology\\n       Director of intERLab         Internetworking; distributed\\ncomputing and Internet foreducation.\\n       M.Sc and Ph.

AIT conducts a diverse \\nrange of activities across the Institute, and this report lists only some of many such initiatives. \\nEven when all of us were severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, AIT continually strives to \\nimplement sustainability in all its core operations, including by creating a platform to showcase \\nits efforts toward the SDGs in a comprehensive and detailed manner.\\nAIT participated for the first time in the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings 2020, \\nwhich looks at global universities’ commitment and performance in furthering the SDGs and \\nAIT ranked #19 in the world for SDG1—No Poverty. The achievement was recognition of AIT’s \\nwork in providing education to students from countries where poverty is an issue, of its research \\non poverty issues, and of its success in producing graduates who go back home to help their \\ncountries eradicate poverty. Likewise, AIT ranked #86 in the world for SDG2—Zero Hunger, \\nwhich indicates a recognition of our education and research on food and food security. Over \\n850 universities from 89 countries participated in this ranking exercise, which also saw AIT’s \\nwork recognized on several other SDG’s.\\nI would like to thank the editorial team which has worked closely with the AIT Schools and \\nCenters in identifying important work that could be showcased.

The objective of the project \\nis to assess the feasibility of weather index insurance in \\nTajikistan and provide recommendations on pilot sites \\nfor launching relevant interventions. Costs involving field \\nvisits to assess and verify damage often makes insurance \\npremiums prohibitively costly to farmers, especially in the \\ndeveloping world. To address this issue, the concept of \\nWeather Index Insurance (WII) was introduced, pay-outs \\nbased primarily on rainfall thresholds. This eliminates \\nfield visits to assess the extent of crop damage, especially \\nin the most remote locations.\\nIn June 2021, FAO launched the fourth version of Global \\nAgro-ecological Zoning (GAEZv4), an easily accessible \\ndata portal containing a large volume of spatial natural \\nresources indicators and results of agro-ecological \\ncrop analyses. Agro-ecological zonation is a concept \\nthat uses established land evaluation principles to \\nidentify land most suitable for agriculture. Applying \\nenvironmental inputs and climate conditions makes it \\npossible to select crop types based on productivity and \\nresilience to changing climate scenarios.\\nWith GAEZv4 launched in mid-2021, the next iteration \\nof the platform, GAEZv5, is currently underway with \\ncontributions from various international collaborators \\nincluding AIT’s GeoInformatics Center (GIC-AIT). \\nGAEZv5 will focus on countries performing their own \\nAEZ analysis. This objective closely matches a tool \\nrecently developed by GIC called “PyAEZ” (Python for \\nAgro-ecological zoning). GIC-AIT’s intent in developing \\nPyAEZ is twofold: 1) to make GAEZ more accessible to \\nusers by transcribing it into a modern scripting language \\n(Python); 2) and to provide users with the capability to \\ninput their own datasets (on a finer scale than global) to \\ncreate AEZ data products with higher resolution.\\nIn 2021, GIC held two training courses for AEZ and PyAEZ \\ntaught by experts from GIC-AIT and FAO. The AEZ course \\nfocused on key modules including climatic data analysis, \\nbiomass and yield, agro-climatic yield constraints, agro-\\nedaphic constraints, and the integration of climatic and \\nedaphic evaluation. The PyAEZ course featured a Python \\nrecap, data preparation, and modules for climate regime, \\ncrop simulation, production costs, and constraints on \\nclimate, soil, and terrain. The training courses were \\nhosted in Google Classrooms and are freely available to \\nanyone interested.

Through its five thematic areas - Climate Change, Smart Communities, Food-\\nEnergy-Water, Infrastructure, and Technology, Policy, and Society - AIT focuses on learning \\nand research strategies that aim to reduce poverty, mitigate risks, conserve resources, and \\ncreate green job opportunities by fostering sustainable livelihoods in Asia.\\nThis report provides a summary of AIT’s activities in 2022, encompassing teaching, research, \\noutreach, public engagement, and operations, in alignment with the SDGs. While this report \\nhighlights some initiatives, AIT undertakes a diverse range of activities across the Institute. \\nAIT strives to provide solutions and recommendations for issues such as climate change, \\nwater and food insecurity, air and plastic pollution, biodegradation, biodiversity loss, and \\nmany others. The Institute’s commitment to sustainable development and positive social \\nimpact is evident in its participation in the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings, \\nwhere it consistently ranks as a frontrunner in the region.\\nAIT aspires to lead by example in practicing and promoting sustainability. It has initiated the \\nBotanical Garden Campus Towards Net Zero, building upon previous campus plans, with the \\ngoal of transforming the entire AIT into a fully-fledged botanical garden and achieving net-\\nzero emissions by 2030. This campus plan aligns with the direction of the Bio-Circular Green \\n(BCG) Economy in Thailand and the Asia-Pacific region, integrating various ecosystems and \\nbiodiversity in the midst of a highly urbanized setting to foster harmonization between nature \\nand humans.\\nI extend my gratitude to the editorial team for their collaboration with AIT Schools and Centers \\nin highlighting important work in this regard.\\nProfessor Kazuo Yamamoto\\nPresident\\nAsian Institute of Technology (AIT)', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Sustainability-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

The IPCC AR6 2022 synthesis \\nreport on Impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability \\nhighlights the existing challenges of climate-resilient \\ndevelopment under current levels of global warming. \\nThese challenges will be further compounded if \\ntemperatures exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius and may \\nbecome insurmountable beyond 2 degrees Celsius. \\nThe report also emphasizes the availability of \\nemission reduction options in every sector that can \\nhalve emissions by 2030.\\nExperts widely agree that the rising temperatures \\ndirectly contribute to the loss of biodiversity and \\ndegradation of ecosystems. Therefore, addressing \\nclimate change and biodiversity loss must be \\npursued together as interconnected existential \\nthreats. AIT is committed to leading by example in \\nthe practice and promotion of sustainability. The \\nAIT campus is renowned for its lush greenery and \\ndiverse biodiversity, harmoniously coexisting with \\nacademic activities. To achieve true sustainability, \\nAIT plans to establish a comprehensive botanical \\ngarden, building upon previous initiatives. This \\ntransformative endeavor aims to make the entire AIT \\ncampus a fully-fledged botanical garden with the \\nambitious target of achieving Net Zero emissions by \\n2030.\\nThe Botanical Garden Campus Towards Net Zero \\nwill integrate and harmonize AIT’s natural assets into a comprehensive plan aligned with the Bio-Circular \\nGreen (BCG) Economy principles, in line with \\nThailand and the Asia-Pacific region’s direction. By \\nincorporating various ecosystems and biodiversity, \\nthe campus will provide a space where nature and \\nhuman activities can coexist harmoniously, even in \\none of Asia’s most urbanized settings.\\nAIT’s sustainability vision for the Botanical Garden \\nCampus is guided by three key principles: \\nconnection to The Queen Sirikit Arboretum, striking a \\nbalance between academia and industry, and open \\naccess to the public. The 130-hectare campus will \\nencompass three specialized zones: the Academic \\nand BOI Science and Technology Zone, the \\nBotanical Residence Zone, and the Botanical Public \\nSpace Zone. These zones will synergize sustainable \\nactivities throughout the campus, contributing to its \\ncarbon-neutral status.\\nBy leveraging its abundant natural biodiversity and \\nhistorical role as an international hub for technology \\nand sustainability in higher education, the Botanical \\nGarden Campus Towards Net Zero is AIT’s response \\nto the urgent climate and biodiversity challenges \\nof our time. The campus aims to attract educators, \\nresearchers, public and private sector partnerships, \\nsocial enterprises, start-ups, responsible investments, \\ncarbon credits, as well as top-class students \\nand researchers. It aspires to become a leading \\nexample of a sustainable academic institution where \\nindividuals can live, study, and work in a carbon-free \\nenvironment in the 21st century.\\nAIT BOTANICAL GARDEN CAMPUS \\nTOWARDS NET ZERO BY 2030 ', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT-Sustainability-Report-2022.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

One of these is the Living \\nDeltas Hub, which is funded for five years (2019-2024) \\nand operates across three delta systems: the Red River, \\nthe Mekong in Vietnam, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-\\nMeghna system in Bangladesh and India. These \\ninterdisciplinary hubs work across 85 countries along \\nwith governments, international agencies, the private \\nsector, and NGOs to develop creative and sustainable \\nsolutions that will help make the world safer, healthier, \\nand more prosperous.\\nRiver deltas comprise just 1% of global landscapes yet \\nsupport over half-a-billion people. Deltas are vital socio-\\necological systems and global food baskets, but the \\nterrain and the livelihoods of those who rely on them are \\nunder threat from human exploitation, environmental \\ndegradation, and climate change. By focusing on three \\ndeltas in Asia, this Hub will promote a model of equitable \\npartnership with delta dwellers and the research \\ncommunity, who will work together to develop new \\nknowledge and policies. The aim is to safeguard the \\nfuture of deltas through more resilient communities and \\nsustainable development. The project also aims to help \\nthe delta countries achieve their SDG Voluntary National \\nReview agendas. The Hub is truly interdisciplinary and \\nbrings together natural and physical sciences, social \\nsciences, and arts and humanities on an equal basis in \\nseeking new solutions to complex, intertwined issues \\nby building on the research already being implemented \\nin delta countries through capacity-building and \\nknowledge co-production toward better futures.      \\n1\\nSUSTAINING AND ENHANCING THE \\nMOMENTUM FOR INNOVATION AND \\nLEARNING AROUND THE SYSTEM OF RICE \\nINTENSIFICATION (SRI) IN THE LOWER \\nMEKONG RIVER BASIN  \\nThis EU-financed regional project aimed at enhancing \\nthe resilience of rainfed farmers confronting climate \\nchange variability in the Lower Mekong Basin). The \\nproject was implemented in four countries: Cambodia, \\nLaos, Vietnam, and Thailand. The total period of \\nimplementation was 72 months, and the total cost of \\nthis action was approximately €3.4 million, with an 85% \\ncontribution from the European Union. The project was \\nled by AIT’s Asian Center for Innovation for Sustainable \\nAgriculture Intensification and implemented in \\npartnership with the FAO, Oxfam, the SRI-Rice Center \\nat Cornell University, and the University of Queensland \\ntogether with many national partners from ministries, \\nnational universities, and NGOs. The main outcomes \\nwere: \\n1. Capacity building and human resource development \\nfor sustainable rice intensification: 15,000 smallholder \\nfarmers trained (over 50% of them women), and \\n15,000 farmer-led trainings conducted.\\n2. Improved livelihoods: 52% higher crop yields per \\nhectare along with 70% higher economic returns.\\n3. Improved resource use efficiency: 64% greater labor \\nproductivity, 59% greater water productivity, and 34% \\nlower energy use per hectare.\\n4. Climate change amelioration and mitigation: 14% and \\n17% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from \\nirrigated and rainfed cropping, respectively.\\nThe results of this farmer-participatory research \\ncharacterize climate-smart agricultural practices that \\ncan promote household food security and support \\nmarket-oriented development at low cost, especially \\nin rainfed areas, which have not figured prominently in \\nnational development plans.\\nSystem of Rice Intensification (SRI) in the Lower \\nMekong River Basin\\nSRI International Network and Resources CenterAIT contributes to reducing poverty by collaborating with \\nglobal research hubs and funding schemes focusing on \\ndeveloping and implementing creative multidisciplinary \\nsolutions to poverty-related conditions affecting the \\nlives of vulnerable populations, including through river \\ndelta preservation and rice farming intensification in \\nlow-income Asian countries.

As an active partner in the Counter MEASURE \\nprogram, the Center developed a region-based model \\nfor monitoring and assessing plastic leakage and \\npollution reduction and co-organized two successful \\nriparian plastic clean-up events in the Lower Mekong \\nRiver Basin. Link to Counter MEASURE project overview:\\nCounter Measures for Plastic Free Rivers\\nThe regional model for monitoring river basin plastic \\nleakage targeted land-based sources of plastic pollution \\nas directed by evidence from previous studies. Five \\npilot sites were selected throughout the Lower Mekong \\nRiver Basin including Chiang Rai and Ubon Ratchathani \\n(Thailand), Vientiane (Laos), Phnom Penh (Cambodia), \\nand Can Tho (Vietnam). The model incorporated a \\nnumber of data sources including land use maps, \\ninfrastructure, population density, and plastic point \\nsource locations such as factories and dump sites. \\nGeospatial analysis by way of a fuzzy overlay approach \\nwas performed to predict plastic leakage density for the \\nlower Mekong River Basin. Results were validated using \\nillegal dump locations collected by field teams at the \\npilot sites. The methodology was developed with the \\naim of repeatability for further studies, including basins \\nbeyond the Mekong such as the Ganges River Basin.\\nPromotion of Countermeasures Against Marine Plastic \\nLitter in Southeast Asia and India\\nAdditionally, the Geoinformatics Center co-organized \\nriverside clean-up events with the UN’s Environment \\nProgram, Pirika Inc. (Japan), and Trash Hero at the \\nThailand pilot sites. A clean-up event in Chiang Rai took \\nplace on World Clean-up Day 2019, when more than 60 \\nlocal volunteers collected 305.5 kg of litter from Chiang \\nRai Beach in the Rop Wiang sub-district. A second clean-\\nup event in Ubon Ratchathani saw the team partner with \\nthe Ubon Ratchathani municipality to clean up Ku Du \\nbeach, located along the Mun river. Local participation \\nnearly doubled for the second event, with more than 100 \\nparticipants from Ubon Ratchathani University and Ubon \\nRatchathani Rajabhat University turning out for the event. \\nThrough both clean-up events, participants were able to \\nactively contribute to Counter-MEASURE project data AIT’s Geoinformatics Center collaboratively addresses \\nriver plastic monitoring and clean-up efforts in the \\nLower Mekong and Ganges River Basins based on \\nstudies conducted in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and \\nVietnam.

I would also like to acknowledge the important role of the Executive and Audit Committees which spends \\na lot of time reviewing and vetting matters prior to their submission to the Board.\\nA stellar function of the year 2018, was the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to AIT on 27 April, \\nduring which HRH formally inaugurated the modernized AIT Library, the AIT Clock Tower, and the new AIT Gate. It was a \\nwell-attended event with donors of funds raised for the modernization of the AIT Library, specially accorded recognition \\nby HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, and HRH also toured the modernized AIT Library. The AIT is blessed by HRH’s \\ngracious royal patronage and is indebted to HRH for her continued support to AIT.\\nOn 30 August 2018 we witnessed another important day in AIT with the formal handing over of the baton of the AIT \\npresidency at the Robert B Banks Auditorium in the presence of the members of the AIT Board of Trustees. It provided an \\nopportune occasion to acknowledge and thank President Worsak Kanok-Nukulchai for his valuable contributions made to \\nthe Institute by putting AIT on a solid footing, while welcoming Dr. Eden Woon as the new AIT President to build on that as \\nAIT faces a crossroad when it approaches its 60th Anniversary.  \\nAfter the AIT President Worsak Kanok-Nukulchai informed the Board that he did not wish to seek a second term, the Board \\nhad set up a Presidential Search Committee (PSC), chaired by Dr. Anat Arbhabhirama, Vice Chairperson of the Board. As \\na rewarding outcome of the rigorous and thorough process of evaluating the prospective presidential candidates by the \\nPSC, the Board unanimously approved to appoint Dr. Eden Woon as the AIT President, effective 1 September 2018. \\nThe Board is confident that the President, Dr. Eden Woon with his diverse international background in academia, business, \\nand extensive management and leadership experiences in different sectors, can help lead AIT to a new level with more \\nglobal recognition. \\nIn concluding, I wish to once again thank all our Trustees and partners, for their strong and continued support to the Insti -\\ntute. The Year 2019 should be exciting and we all look forward to celebrating the AIT’s 60th Anniversary together. \\nDr. Subin Pinkayan\\nChairman\\nBoard of Trustees\\nAsian Institute of Technology (AIT)\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='5\\nAIT ANNUAL REPORT 2018\\nMESSAGE FROM THE AIT PRESIDENT\\nI had the honor of arriving at AIT to serve as its 9th President on 1 September 2018.  I came with a determination to take AIT to greater \\nheights, leveraging on its legacy of contributing to societies in Asia. When I came on board, the first thing I noticed was the good work \\nthat previous President Worsak Kanok-Nukulchai did in making AIT once again a steady ship. In fact, much of what you read in this Annual \\nReport 2018 was under his able leadership.  \\nThe Presidential Search Committee and the Board of Trustees expected me to now take the ship forward.  The strategy that I envisioned \\nfor AIT was coined as I2E2S2. It stands for Innovation, Internationalization, Enterprises, Entrepreneurship, Stakeholders , and Support .  \\nAnd these are the six strategic focus areas which I would like to see AIT work on, while leveraging on its social impact core strengths.  \\nBriefly, AIT will be seeing more  innovation  in its research and in its teaching, injecting more leading-edge technology—and more mul -\\nti-disciplinary perspectives—into our social impact research. Education will be more experiential and not confined to classrooms and \\nlaboratories.  Exchanges and Internships and Service Learnings and more hands-on work will be part of the future degree requirements.  \\nAnd we will be doing all this through internationalization  by forging relations with partners from near and faraway. AIT will re-establish \\nits global footprint and global influence. This gives our students and faculty a broader horizon to view their research and education in a \\nglobalized world.  \\nAIT will also forge closer relations with enterprises , in addition to its traditional partners in governments and the NGO world.  Our rel -\\nevance will be improved through more collaboration, more training, and more dialogue with industries.  We must be more in tune with \\nenterprises’ needs as they fuel the economy of countries which our students come from. In addition, at a time when young men and \\nwomen are interested in starting their own businesses, AIT will establish an Entrepreneurship  Center in 2019 to provide mentorship and \\nknowledge and networks to nurture those interested in their own start-ups.\\nStudents will be our top priority stakeholders  in the future AIT, as campus environment and services will be improved.  Alumni engage -\\nment will deepen and broaden. AIT will become a more sustainable and caring and cost-efficient campus.  Finally, to do all of the above, \\nour funding scheme must be improved.  More support  will be solicited from donors, from companies, and from alumni to help AIT grow \\nin scholarship and in student life.  \\nThat is I2E2S2 in short, but to accomplish these tasks, we must transform AIT. And Transforming AIT has become the motto for our 60th \\nanniversary year 2019. Only then can we hope to build on our legacy and expand our reputation. I am looking forward to working with \\nthe students, staff, faculty, Board members, and friends of AIT in this endeavor!\\nEden Y Woon\\nPresident\\nAsian Institute of Technology (AIT)\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

An RC is a unit that is expected to \\ngenerate sufficient revenues to fully cover its direct and indirect \\nexpenses. As a financial incentive, an RC retains part of its net sur -\\nplus into its Capital Fund.\\nThe Responsibility Center Management (RCM) concept was cre -\\nated at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s as a re -\\nsponse to a financial crisis and is now widely used in most univer -\\nsities in the US. The RCM system provides an incentive structure \\nthat encourages and rewards revenue generation and cost sav -\\nings at all levels. It requires awareness among all faculty and staff \\nmembers of financial implications of decisions at the policy and \\noperational levels.\\nUnder the RCM system, each AIT unit can be categorized as either \\na Responsibility Center (RC) or a Service Center (SC).\\nCurrently, AIT has three (3) academic RCs and 13 Outreach RCs.\\nAcademic RCs:\\n1.

SURENDRA SHRESTHA  \\n(January to June 2018)\\nThis brief report provides an update on the initiatives and oppor -\\ntunities ahead within the scope of the main responsibilities as -\\nsigned, namely: i) developing an innovative institute strategy; ii) \\nexploring new partnerships to support the implementation of the \\nstrategy; and iii) enhancing partnerships with alumni (AITAA).\\n1. Brief on the Three Assigned Tasks\\nSTRATEGY:  An Institute-wide Committee has completed the main \\nelements of a new strategy following a thorough review of existing \\ndocuments. Committee consultations included discussions with \\nfaculty, senior staff, and students. The Strategy includes holistic \\nintegration of traditional strengths, focusing on regional priorities \\nto better prepare work-ready graduates for the 21st century. The \\nStrategy proposes a business model that looks more Eastern than \\nWestern. The Strategy and a Resource Plan will be articulated \\nupon confirmation by Management.\\nPARTNERSHIPS:  Partnerships work focused on the following \\nthree areas: national governments; raising visibility; and in-house \\nteamwork, especially for AIT Day.\\nThe following governments have either confirmed or are in the \\nprocess of confirmation that they will provide full scholarships, \\nresearch grants, or support for short-term training: Afghanistan, \\nCambodia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, and the Philip -\\npines. Regular follow-up with these countries is recommended.\\nTo raise AIT’s visibility, the following actions have been com -\\npleted: i) AIT has registered with the UN Secretariat, UN ESCAP, \\nILO, UNDP, UNCRD, and UNEP; ii) AIT is one of the core partners \\nin the Global Forum on Technology for SDGs (G-STIC) leading ur -\\nban and agriculture clusters; AIT is participating in many higher \\neducation forums in the region (Himalayan University Consortium, \\nAfghanistan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, and the Philippines).\\nThree Institute-wide initiatives have been established, bringing \\nfaculty and staff from Schools and Centers for an interdisciplinary \\nteam approach. These Initiatives include: Climate Change, Urbani -\\nzation, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). AIT has start -\\ned engagement for building capacity in these regional priorities.\\nALUMNI:  Alumni are the biggest resource for our Institute. Senior \\nalumni are in positions of power and influence in both the public \\nand the private sectors. All country visits and six (6) AIT Day na -\\ntional events have been organized working closely with alumni. \\nThe Institute must do more to strengthen this partnership for mu -\\ntual gain.2. Opportunities\\nAIT is a known brand name. The first half of the Institute’s history \\nwitnessed its establishment and rapid growth, while the second \\nhalf witnessed a multitude of challenges and a gradual erosion of \\nthe brand as well as the Institute’s international status. Looking \\nahead, AIT has an opportunity to serve as a capacity building, “go-\\nto” institution focused on the nexus of technology, development, \\nand knowledge. Some of the key opportunities for our Institute \\ninclude:\\nA. INTEGRATED APPROACH:  21st-century education is rapidly \\nmoving from a “silo” approach to more holistic, integrated learn -\\ning. It is not so much what knowledge should be acquired as how \\nthat knowledge should be utilized for innovative solutions of real \\nproblems, which will include critical thinking skills. The future will \\ninvolve intrinsic motivation and design.\\nB. WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITY (WCU):  As the economic center \\nof gravity moves from West to East, countries in Asia will set the \\nnorms, values, and standards for higher education for the 21st \\ncentury. Many of the countries in the region have announced \\nthe establishment of WCUs that are more international as well as \\nautonomous and endowed with substantial resources. Plans of \\nWCUs include moving from teacher-focused to student-focused \\nclassrooms. AIT should be engaged in supporting the establish -\\nment of WCUs. AIT will need to consider franchising its brand \\nacross the region and be at the center of the hub as WCUs emerge \\nin the coming years.\\nC. RESOURCES FOR AIT:  Current operational resources are pro -\\nvided mainly through the generous support of the Thai Govern -\\nment. The work done in the past 12 months shows that a business \\nmodel focusing on meeting capacity building needs in areas of \\npriority for the region is feasible. Building on the AIT brand and \\nquickly adapting to the needs of the region will be the key. An \\nagile AIT adapting to the fast-changing needs of the region will \\nensure growth and success. There is an opportunity for AIT to \\ngain international status and serve Asia as well as the developing \\nworld.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

FREEK OLAF DE GROOT\\nOver 2018, AIT’s Language Center (LC) has continued to ensure \\nthat students from all over the world are able to succeed in AIT’s \\ninternational environment. In 2018, LC provided services to over \\n1,000 students participating in more than 2,500 hours of lan -\\nguage-related class time.\\nIn addition to its core activity of developing academic English \\nskills for postgraduate students, LC worked with other AIT Units \\nand Schools to offer language-related services where needed. LC \\nservices are instrumental in improving communication and under -\\nstanding in AIT’s diverse environment.\\nAIT’s LC has continued to play a significant role in education \\nboth locally and internationally. It has continued to offer its exist -\\ning package of courses, including the Bridging Program, foreign \\nlanguage courses (see below), and research skills development \\nworkshops. In addition, LC has started the development of a range \\nof online English language courses and academic workshops that \\nwill be offered from Q1 of 2019.\\nAs part of one of Asia’s leading institutions of higher learning, \\nAIT’s LC strives for high standards of English proficiency. It works \\nto ensure that all undergraduate and postgraduate students have \\nthe English skills necessary to study at AIT and to compete in the \\ninternational community. In 2018, AIT’s LC was able to provide \\nEnglish Entry Testing (ETT) to a wider community inside and out -\\nside Thailand through a new online testing application that allows \\ntest-takers to take tests online in a secure environment. This easier \\naccess to English language testing supports AIT in its recruitment \\nactivities. Around 850,000 THB was collected from both onsite \\nand online testing.\\nFor exceptional students who have been allowed to enroll at AIT \\ndespite having English scores below AIT’s admission require -\\nments, LC offers a range of English language courses aimed \\nat rapidly improving students’ English abilities until they have \\nreached the level deemed appropriate for their degree program. In \\n2018, LC continued the co-payment system and recovered about \\ntwo-thirds of the cost of running these courses. However, LC still \\nneeds to heavily subsidize these fees in order to continue to offer \\nthese courses.\\nLC believes in offering language skills beyond English communi -\\ncation. In 2018, French, Chinese, and Thai were offered to the AIT \\ncommunity. More than 100 students were able to study on these \\ncourses at prices substantially lower than the market rate, and \\n100,000 THB in revenues was generated from these courses.\\nOther Units and Schools collaborated with LC on various projects \\nover the past year. LC managed and taught Technical Writing, \\nEnglish, French, and Chinese courses for the SET and SERD un -\\ndergraduate (UG) programs.Although LC was able to recover a substantial percentage of its \\noperating expenses, this amount was less than in previous years \\ndue to a decline in student numbers and the loss of a substan -\\ntial source of revenue as a result of phasing out the undergradu -\\nate program. For 2019, LC aims at expanding its current range of \\ncost-effective projects in order to raise additional revenues beside \\nthe fees for services provided to the Schools. In the coming years, \\nLC intends to diversify the modes in which it offers its services by \\nextending its current activities to online platforms as well as con -\\ntinuing with the provision of services on campus.

LOUIS HORNYAK\\nSummary\\nThe Center of Excellence in Nanotechnology (COEN) has under -\\ngone a transition. A new director has been selected and should be \\nin place early in 2019. The director is to serve as part-time faculty \\nin the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering (ISE) as a Pro -\\nfessor in the nanotechnology field of study and simultaneously as \\nDirector of COEN.\\nCOEN’s seven laboratories were very busy in 2018. COEN sup -\\nported the research work of five Ph.D. students, seven regular \\nMasters degree students, and seven non-thesis Masters degree \\nstudents. Outside of ISE in AIT, COEN supported the development \\nof one Ph.D. student (RS&GIS) and five Master’s degree students \\nfrom Transportation (TRE), ME (Mechatronics), and EEM (Environ -\\nmental Engineering & Management). COEN’s relationships with \\nThailand’s National Science & Technology Development Agency \\n(NSTDA) continued to grow as three students have conducted \\ntheir research at the National Nanotechnology Center (NANOTEC) \\nand the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center \\n(NECTEC). One student has joined the Metal and Materials Tech -\\nnology Center (MTEC) to begin work in 2019.\\nDiscussions are underway to merge COEN back into SET. This \\nwould turn COEN into a research center within the School and no \\nlonger a Responsibility Center. A decision will be made during the \\nfirst quarter of 2019.\\nPublication Activity\\nCOEN has supported the research for publication of two papers in 2018. Due to the achievement of a critical mass of students over \\nthe past four years, COEN is expected to publish 15 to 20 papers \\nin 2019 (with 11 manuscripts in preparation). Additionally, COEN \\nparticipated in a six-nation characterization calibration study \\nwith NANOTEC and plans to continue with the thrust of related \\nresearch in 2019. A publication is expected from this work. In ad -\\ndition, COEN is expected to participate along with NANOTEC in its \\nfirst patent application in over five years.\\nInvitations for joint publications were received from Columbia Uni -\\nversity, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and the California \\nInstitute of Technology.\\nApplied Science and Technology Support\\nAlong with the Nanotechnology Academic Program, COEN con -\\ntinues to supply a valuable Applied Science & Technology com -\\nponent to AIT’s engineering activities. This is evidenced as COEN’s \\noutreach to other departments in AIT is growing. COEN currently \\nhas relationships with Mechatronics Engineering, Civil Engineer -\\ning, Environmental Engineering & Management, Energy, Transpor -\\ntation Engineering, and Remote Sensing & GIS. Industry too needs \\napplied research in order to enhance or develop new product lines. \\nThis is an extension of the logical and practical functions of applied \\nscience and technology capabilities adapted across the globe.\\nCOEN and the nanotechnology field of study have a good fit \\nwithin the mission of NANOTEC and other national laboratories in \\nNSTDA due to the applied science and technology orientation of \\nnanotechnology in general.\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",

Corrosion capability using the ad -\\nvanced Autolab electrochemical work station is another example \\nof COEN’s drive to contribute solutions to relevant and pressing \\ntechnological issues. COEN’s gas flow measurement apparatus is \\nalso on its way to completing the assembly. Gas flow capability \\nis important in the development of sensing components. COEN \\nput considerable effort into training students in laboratory safety \\nand emergency procedures, and it plans to further reinforce this \\nimportant trend in 2019. \\nSimulation and Modeling\\nOur simulation and modeling capability is an ever-important activ -\\nity and has grown over the past year. Specifically, modeling the \\nphysical properties of nanomaterials has become highly accurate. \\nIn the long term, it is a priority for COEN to fill the empty niche of \\nnation-wide simulation support in Thailand. COEN has a world-\\nclass resident adjunct professor on staff, with expertise in simula -\\ntion and modeling.\\nSimulation support is well received by industry. COEN’s industry \\nclients have experienced the predictive capability of these meth -\\nods. One example is Neon Infotech experimental design and pro -\\ntotype development of anti-reflective and self-cleaning surfaces. \\nSimulations are also aiding IDEAL Fasteners in developing anti-im -\\npact and wash/drying resistant coatings for their products. Simu -\\nlations are aiding the White Group in developing a new integrated \\nbattery for solar cell energy storage.\\nIndustry Outreach\\nCOEN continues to pursue excellence in industry relations. The \\nproject with Neon Infotech has received 1.5 million THB in fund -\\ning in 2018, and expectations are positive that future and higher \\nlevels of funding will be forthcoming in 2019. Although IDEAL \\nFasteners funding is expected to end in 2019, given recent suc -\\ncesses, COEN expects to continue relationships with this Hong \\nKong company. The Donaldson Company work is still pending \\nwith the expected release of 500,000 THB in 2019. Research sup -\\nported by the 1 million THB received from the White Group to de -\\nvelop a better battery is still in progress.

MANZUL HAZARIKA\\nThe Geoinformatics Center conducted several projects related to \\nRemote Sensing and GIS applications, mainly in the areas of dis -\\naster management and crop monitoring. It also conducted two \\nregional training courses, one in state-of-the-art GNSS technology \\nand another in use of drones, satellite imagery, and GIS for agri -\\nculture. A brief description of the Center’s activities is given below.\\n1) Uttarakhand Disaster Risk Database Development\\nThe Geoinformatics Center successfully completed a World Bank \\nfunded project for developing a disaster risk database in the State \\nof Uttarakhand, India. On 12 September 2018, the Disaster Risk \\nDatabase at Uttarakhand was launched by the Finance Minister of \\nUttarakhand State, Mr. Prakash Pant. GIC worked with two interna -\\ntional firms, DHI (Singapore) and ERN (Mexico) to create the data -\\nbase, which covers earthquakes, landslides, floods, and industrial \\nhazards and associated risks. This multi-hazard risk assessment \\neffort was initiated by the World Bank funded Uttarakhand Disas -\\nter Recovery Project following the 2013 cloudburst that caused \\nsignificant loss of life and property. Close to 80,000 different earth -\\nquake scenarios have been modelled, and this will greatly help \\nnot only in risk reduction but also in rapid damage assessment \\nand mitigation efforts. \\n2) Disaster Response Activities under the Sentinel Asia \\nProject\\nThe Geoinformatics Center is the Principal Data Analysis Node \\n(P-DAN) of the Sentinel Asia project and receives an annual grant \\nfrom Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for satellite \\ndata processing, acquired immediately after a disaster. In 2018, \\nSentinel Asia was activated on more than 25 occasions, including \\nthe earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia, a particularly \\ncatastrophic event. The Center was appointed Project Manager \\nfollowing the escalation of Sentinel Asia to the International Disas -\\nter Charter. Nearly 500 pre-and post-disaster images from leading \\nsatellite image providers around the world were received to con -\\nduct the damage assessment. A web-based GIS platform (http://\\narcg.is/15uObi) was created to provide information on damage \\nto buildings and infrastructures along with field data collected \\nthrough an extensive mapping exercise conducted on the ground \\nin collaboration with national and international organizations.\\n3) Monitoring Rice Health and Yield Forecasting Using \\nRemote Sensing Technologies\\nThe Geoinformatics Center conducted a study of monitoring \\nrice health and yield with remote sensing technology, with spe -\\ncial focus on drones. The study was conducted at a rice farm \\nowned by Mr. Samruay Pungdee in central Thailand’s Ang Tong \\nProvince. Rice growth was monitored with an unmanned aerial \\nvehicle equipped with a lightweight multi-spectral sensor. The \\nsensor provided data in red edge and near infrared wavelengths \\nas well as two visible bands, allowing for in-depth analysis of the \\nrice field. Additionally, GNSS technology was used to perform a \\nground survey of the area, which resulted in a geometric accu -racy of less than one pixel of the 8cm spatial resolution for UAV \\nreflectance maps. Derived normalized difference vegetation index \\n(NDVI) imagery was in line with rice cycle phenology. Rice yield \\nwas estimated with satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolu -\\ntion Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) combined with 9-year \\nhistorical rice yield for Ang Tong province. The resulting regres -\\nsion depicted a positive relationship between maximum NDVI \\nvalue and provincial rice yield, indicating that our model can be \\nused to estimate rice yield reasonably well.\\n4) Flood and Storm Surge Risk Assessment Tools for ADB \\nSpatial Data Analysis Explorer\\nThe Geoinformatics Center implemented an ADB project on Flood \\nand Storm Surge Risk Assessment Tools for ADB Spatial Data \\nAnalysis Explorer (SPADE). The aim of the project was to support \\na range of activities that generate and nurture the application of \\nspatial information technology to contribute to sustainable and \\nresilient infrastructure planning, primarily on projects supported \\nby the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF). \\nFlood hazard and risk assessment were conducted in three sec -\\nondary cities in Viet Nam, namely Hue, Vinh Yen, and Ha Giang.\\n5) GNSS Training\\nThe Geoinformatics Center organized a Regional Training on \\nGNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) at AIT on 23-26 Jan -\\nuary 2018 in collaboration with the University of Tokyo and the \\nInternational Committee on GNSS (ICG) of the United Nations. \\nA total of 67 participants from 15 Asian countries attended the \\nfour-day training course. Trainers included some of the most re -\\nnowned in the field of GNSS, hailing from the US, Japan, Australia, \\nand Austria.\\n 6) Drone Training\\nThe Geoinformatics Center organized a Regional Training on Use of \\nDrones, Satellite Imagery, and GIS for Agriculture on 4-8 June 2018 \\nin collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \\nand the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The five-day \\ntraining program was joined by participants from 11 countries (Fiji, \\nSamoa, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Bhutan, the Philippines, \\nLaos, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Pakistan, and Thailand). Topics in -\\ncluded drone mission planning, aerial image collection theory, \\nand drone image processing.

       " Document(page_content='61\\nREPORTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND RESPONSIBILITY CENTERS\\nAIT Assets  \\nDIRECTOR: MR. WANCHAI SOPHONSAKULRAT\\nThe Office of Facilities and Asset Management (OFAM) started op -\\nerations on 1 July 2014. The main objective of OFAM is to manage \\nAIT facilities and assets. The management of facilities and assets \\ncan be classified into three Groups: A) Campus Maintenance, B) \\nAsset Management, and C) Campus Services.\\nA. Campus Maintenance: 1. Technical Maintenance; 2. Ground \\nMaintenance and Landscape; 3. Security; 4. Janitorial Servic -\\nes; 5. Pest Control; and 6. Waste Water Treatment.\\nB. Asset Management: 1. Accommodation; 2. Auxiliary services; \\n3. AIT Conference Center; 4. Cafeteria; and 5. Golf Course.\\nC. Campus Services: 1. Office administration; 2. Call centers, 3. \\nMotor and labor pool; and 4. Reception, mail, and telephone.\\nDuring 2016-2017, AIT Administration implemented the concepts \\nof SC (Service Center) and RC (Responsibility Center) units. All of -\\nfices under Administration and the Institute are classified by their \\nfunction and responsibility as well as budgeting as SC or RC units. \\nHowever, OFAM, which performs functions and responsibilities in \\nboth categories, was defined as both RC (AIT asset) and SC (Cam -\\npus services and maintenance). Its performance of each unit will \\nbe evaluated in terms of pre-defined KPI values compared to the \\ntarget. OFAM maintains 2 KPI sets, one for its SC unit and one for \\nits RC unit. However, for AIT Assets management, only OFAM-RC’s \\nKPI will be described further.\\n OFAM Assets generate revenues from five units: 1. Accommoda -\\ntion; 2. Auxiliary (concessionaire) service; 3. AIT Conference Cent -\\ner hotel and dining room; 4. Cafeteria; and 5. AIT motor pool. Five \\nKPIs were developed to cover three aspects of business operation \\nstrategies, as follows;\\n1. Financial performance (surplus of all operations units, per -\\ncentage (%) occupancy and revenues)\\n2. Quality control (customer satisfaction)\\n3. Delivery service (completion time of customer requests)\\nData from these indicators for 2016, 2017, and 2018 and targets \\nfor 2019 are shown below:\\nNo. KPI for RC units of OFAM 2016 2017 20182019\\n(target)\\n1 Percentage surplus of OFAM RC \\nunits (%)79.3 78.2 76.2 78.0\\n2 Percentage occupancy of AITCC \\nhotel (%)30.8 36.7 38.7 40.0\\n3 Annual AITCC dining room \\nrevenues (million THB)9.9 9.7 8.8 10.0\\n4 Customer satisfaction (average of \\nall units) (%)69.4 71.8 72.0 73.0\\n5 Average completion time of \\ncustomer requests (no. of days)4.3 4.5 5.0 4.0The below data show that the performance of the OFAM-RC unit \\ndecreased slightly in 2018 compared to 2017. However, in 2019, \\nOFAM has plans to improve the performance of the revenue-gen -\\nerating units by raising AITCC revenues through new strategies \\nand a marketing plan, a review of the concessionaire rental struc -\\nture, improvements in AITCC’s main wing rooms, and a review of \\naccommodation rental rates. Once these improvement plans are \\nexecuted, OFAM is confident that it will achieve the set target for \\n2019.\\nCampus Rehabilitation Update\\nOn 26 February 2015, Administration received approval from the \\nAIT Board of Trustees for using the rest of the insurance funds to \\nreplace, rejuvenate, and upgrade the entire infrastructure back -\\nbone of the AIT campus: 1. air-conditioning system; (2) electrical \\nsystem; (3) water supply system; (4) waste water system; and (5) \\nground and pavement system.\\nHowever, as the Institute held a very important event in April 2018, \\nnamely the visit of HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn for the \\ngrand opening of the newly renovated AIT Library, the major up -\\ngrade of the campus infrastructure was slightly adjusted, as follows:\\n1) Air conditioning system: In 2017, OFAM planned to upgrade \\nthe air-conditioning networks in the Academic North and \\nSouth buildings. However, due to the urgency of improve -\\nments in other air-conditioning units in the Administration \\nbuilding, works were postponed. In addition, from the avail -\\nable budget after renovation of Administration buildings and \\ngiven the proposed high renovation cost for two buildings, \\nthe work will be done in section zone by zone within the avail -\\nable budget in 2019. The rest will be done using the yearly \\nassets budget.\\n2) Electrical system: Substation 1 was relocated and recon -\\nstructed at the front gate due to the relocation of the security \\nguard house and reconstruction of a laterite wall, which will \\ngive the Institute a new look. In addition, improvements were \\ncarried out on Substation no.5 at AITCC to accommodate the \\nnew construction of the AITCC Annex building in March 2018. \\nUpgrades to other substations and the installation of new LED \\nstreet lights to cover all main roads within the campus will \\ncommence in the first half of 2019.\\n3) Water supply: All major improvement works of main water \\nsupply pipeline are complete. The rest consist of upgrades \\nto the sub-branch pipeline that supplies water to houses and \\ndormitories. In 2018, OFAM installed a new water pipeline \\nfrom ST-6 to the 7-11 convenience store and from Dormitory P \\nto the ST-12 building. In conclusion, all backbone upgrades to \\nthe water supply networks have been completed.\\n4) Wastewater system: The wastewater pipeline and the pump -\\ning manhole in ST4 and ST5 areas were improved. The next \\nproject will be the improvement of pumps at pumping stations \\nall over the campus.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

My responsibilities under those standards are further de -\\nscribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Institute in \\naccordance with Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Federation of Accounting Professions that is relevant to my \\naudit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. I believe that \\nthe audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with TFRS for NPAEs, and \\nfor such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from ma -\\nterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern, \\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either \\nintends to liquidate the Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nOther Information\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but \\ndoes not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to me after \\nthe date of this auditor’s report. \\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance conclusion \\nthereon. \\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it be -\\ncomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my \\nknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nWhen I read the annual report, if I conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, I am required to communicate the matter to the \\nmanagement and request that the correction be made.\\nAuditor’ s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements \\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, \\nwhether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assur -\\nance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with TSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be \\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \\n  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the cir -\\ncumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Institute’s internal control.\\n  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \\nmade by management. \\n  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \\nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Institute’s ability \\nto continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report \\nto the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions \\nare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the \\nInstitute to cease to continue as a going concern. \\n  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the finan -\\ncial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \\nI communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit find -\\nings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n(Sasithorn Pongadisak) \\nCertified Public Accountant \\nRegistration No. 8802\\nKPMG Phoomchai Audit Ltd. \\nBangkok \\n27 June 2019\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT.AnnualReport.2018.pdf', 'page': 75}),\n",

While certainly destructive to infrastructure, the \\ndevastating flood that submerged our campus nevertheless failed to wash away the AIT Com-\\nmunity’s most precious commodity – its spirit of international solidarity and goodwill.\\nThe AIT’s journey forward passed a significant historical signpost this year, when a new Charter \\nwas signed by twelve countries and one international organization. By moving towards becom-ing a fully fledged intergovernmental organization, a new era dawns for this noble institute \\nsituated in Thailand.  \\nH.E.

Across our faculty, staff, students, alumni, friends, partners, supporters and stakeholders, the Institute achieved great results through ever more partnerships \\nwith public and private sector enterprises, all the while emphasizing excellence and practicality in the \\ndelivery of cutting edge new knowledge and enhanced human capital. \\nIn 2011, the Institute proudly finalized development of its research policy and research umbrella of  \\n“Sustainable Development in the context of Climate Change”. The five identified thematic areas of  focus – Disaster Risk Management; Sustainable Land and Water Resources Management; Business \\nand Innovation Models for a Green Economy; Urban and Rural Quality of Life and Sustainability; \\nLower Carbon, and Sustainable Production & Consumption Technologies & Management – aim to boost sustainable development of the region by strengthening its overall knowledge, development and business capacity, and by supporting communities and their sustainable economic development. \\nThroughout the year, a number of significant strides were made to enhance the overall delivery of quality \\nlearning through the introduction of innovative professional master’s programs, regular postgraduate programs and the expansion of offerings in our new undergraduate programs. The inauguration of  the new China Office in Shanghai, the official launch of the on campus AIT Consulting office, and the significant expansion of AIT Vietnam’s facility, signified our continued ambition to connect our experts and knowledge to opportunities and emerging markets.\\nNear the end of the year, however, as a result of the Great Thailand Flood in 2011, the Asian Institute \\nof Technology endured its greatest ever natural disaster and was forced to evacuate its cherished home \\ncampus.  Indeed, AIT was crippled, with 50 percent of its infrastructure completely destroyed.

In the meantime, the water lev-els of all reservoirs and canals inside and out -\\nside AIT were significantly reduced.

Benefitting from the strong New research Strategy Developed in 2011\\nsupport of governments, non-governmental or -\\nganizations, alumni networks, and research and developmental partners, AIT is now in a very good position to achieve its goals, as has been outlined in the strategy document.\\nAIT wishes to thank the Swedish Developmental \\nAgency (Sida) for all its support to develop AIT Re-search Strategy 2012-2016 and for its guidance in using the Results Based Management (RBM) methodology. The framework of the document includes the overall objective of the strategy, the various outcomes that will help achieve the \\noverall objective, the inputs that will be required \\nto achieve the outcomes, the monitoring mecha-nisms that will indicate the progress being made, and the responsibilities and accountability cen-ters of departments and people concerned.

One of the most \\ninteresting developments was the growth of the AIT Bridging Program from 9 May – 19 July, which \\nboasted 40 new students representing 7 different \\nnationalities entering 12 different fields of study at AIT in August. \\nIn addition to the regular LC staff, these 40 stu-\\ndents studied with AIT resource people (8 doctoral \\nand 2 master’s students) representing the various fields of study. Later in 2011, the AIT Professional \\nBridging Program was attended by 8 special stu-\\ndents (two each from Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thai-\\nland and Vietnam) who are now working for the \\nMekong River Commission in various programs from the Delta to Luang Prabang, Lao PDR. This \\nprogram was nearing its completion when all \\nparticipants were suddenly thrust into returning \\nhome because of the flooding of the campus in \\nOctober.   \\nSharing the 2011 flood experience with the LC \\nstaff were two new members of the Language \\nCenter. Though recently hired, both worked resil-iently during the flood and quickly became valued \\nmembers of the LC team.  Ms. Juliette François, \\nwho teaches French for the AIT community and \\nthe undergraduate program, came to AIT through \\nthe auspices of the French Cooperation. Mr. Thom-as Hamilton, who is finishing his doctoral degree \\nin Applied Linguistics (Language Education) at \\nKMUT-Thonburi, has been teaching and coordinat-ing English Communication Skills and Technical \\nWriting for the School of Engineering undergradu-\\nate program. Both taught numerous classes at \\nAIT in Khlong Luang as well as in Hua Hin.\\nThe LC was able to maintain its testing programs \\nfor nearly 2,000 test-takers throughout the year \\nwithout interruption.  Toward year’s end, though, \\nsome test-takers in Thailand had to find their way on the Chulalongkorn University campus. The bulk \\nof test-takers in various Asian countries from Af-\\nghanistan to Vietnam may have had no idea that \\ntheir test was arranged and sent remotely from \\nNepal, then scored in Hua Hin, with scores set out to them from an office in Bangkok – virtually \\nseamless thanks to the Internet.  \\nAcademics', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT_AnnualReport_2011.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n",

As part of its 52nd Anniversary celebration held on September 5, AIT celebrated \\nthat tradition by showcasing the latest techno -\\nlogical breakthroughs taking place at its Center \\nof Excellence in Nanotechnology (CoEN).  \\nA whopping 16 nanotechnology products and \\nprocesses were introduced at the signature “Nanotechnology Portfolio Release” event. The technologies shown to the public were explained \\nand highlighted for their social impact as well as \\ntheir spin-off potential for investors.\\nUnveiling the raft of nano-scale technologies de-\\nveloped at AIT , which ranged from hand-held so-lar water purifiers to gas sensors and from pro-cesses for fingerprint identification to metal ion sensing in polluted water, CoEn Director Prof. Jordeep Dutta, said the portfolio release was a culmination of five years of extensive research at the Center of Excellence.\\nPatents are pending for four of the technologies, \\nProf. Dutta said, while another seven technolo -\\ngies were successfully demonstrated. Others have been completed, and are ready for patent -\\ning and market release.\\nOne key achievement of his team, Prof. Dutta \\nsaid, was that AIT has demonstrated the use of sunlight for purifying water. \\n\"Most studies so far either work on the use \\nof ultraviolet light or involve a suspension of nanoparticles but the AIT research group has dispensed with both.” The center’s nanoparticle-based water purifier needs no electricity to oper -\\nate and is a handheld device, he added.\\nAttracting attention was as is a fingerprint iden-\\ntification technology where nanoparticles attach only to the ridges of the finger, and leave very little residue. Nanoparticles applied on fingers enhance contrast, making the process simpler and easier. The technique can also be used on wet surfaces, unlike traditional fingerprinting.\\nAlso shown was an LPG gas-based sensor that \\nseeks to minimize explosive gas-related acci -\\ndents and is a high density, low power device. Additional innovations were self-cleaning sur -\\nfaces which could be applied immediately, dis-pensing with the need to clean building surfaces, allowing savings in spent in maintenance.\\nAnother interesting product was the nanopar -\\nticle inkjet printer which is suitable for regular \\nlaboratory use. Photocatalytic paper is a type of \\npaper that is reusable and has lower ink absor -\\nbency. The paper is low cost and environmentally \\nfriendly. Nano solar cells are a product which are low cost and represent an efficient and cost-ef-fective energy source. \\nJointly established by the National Science and \\nTechnology Development Agency (NSTDA) of \\nThailand and AIT in April 2006, the Center of Ex-\\ncellence in Nanotechnology is a state-of-the-art research and development facility dedicated to research, and top-class education and training of professionals in nanotechnology. The center is known for making use of inexpensive wet-chemical methods to fabricate innovative mate-rials, along with futuristic components, devices and applications. \\n“All these products and processes have been \\ndeveloped within five years of establishment of CoEN,” Prof. Dutta said. AIT’s CoEN is one of the eight centers of Excellence under Thailand \\nNational Nanotechnology Center (NANOTEC).\\n“Our portfolio release in nanotechnology is \\nunique and the first-of-its-kind in Thailand and the region,” Prof. Dutta added. “It culminates \\nfrom intense collaboration between AIT and \\nNSTDA.”\\nThe CoEN Director attributes much of AIT’s ', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT_AnnualReport_2011.pdf', 'page': 121}),\n",

Nanorods grown on glass \\nsubstrates and activated by solar energy have \\nbeen found to be effective in killing both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.\\nThe research findings have immense possibili-\\nties for affordable and environmentally friendly water purification techniques.\\n“Most studies so far either work on the use \\nof ultraviolet light or involve a suspension of \\nnanoparticles”, revealed Professor Joydeep \\nDutta, director of the Centre for Excellence in Nanotechnology at AIT . The AIT research group has dispensed with both. Instead of using a suspension of nanoparticles (which have to be removed later after the water purification pro-cess) or relying on UV light, the group demon-strated a system featuring visible light and ZnO nanorods. “The key concept was to incorporate deliberate defects in ZnO nanorods by creating oxygen vacancies and interstitials, which then allows visible light absorption”, he explained.\\nSuch ZnO nanorods grown on glass were tested \\non Escherichia coli andBacillus subtilis bac-\\nteria, which are commonly used as model mi-crobes. ZnO dissolves slowly in the dark while releasing zinc ions which have anti bacterial properties; these penetrate the bacterial cell envelope, thereby thwarting the growth of mi-crobes. Under well-lit conditions, the effect is doubled with both photocatalysis and zinc ions playing their part in killing the microbes.\\nThe implications of these experiments are enor -\\nmous. “Since ZnO has now been tested under \\nsolar light instead of the traditionally used UV \\nlight, the potential for commercial applications is huge. This is particularly true since the levels of zinc ions removed from the rods to the water are safe for human consumption”, added Dutta.\\nThe team, which also includes Oleg V Shipin, \\nAjaya Sapkota, Alfredo J Anceno, Sunandan Ba-\\nruah and Mayuree Jaisai, is continuing its work \\non photocatalysis for use in water decontami-nation.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT_AnnualReport_2011.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

These English language financial statements \\nhave been prepared from the Thai language statutory financial statements, and were approved and authorized for issue by the President of the Institute on 8 May 2012.\\n1. General information      \\nThe Asian Institute of Technology (“the Institute”) is a regional post-graduate institution. The Institute operates on a not-for-profit basis.  The Institute is \\nlocated at Km 42 Paholyothin Highway, Klong Luang, \\nPathumthani, Thailand.\\nThe principal activities of the Institute are providing \\nprograms in engineering, science, advanced technologies \\nand related management and administration.\\n2. Basis of preparation of financial statements\\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with Thai Financial Reporting Standard for Non-publicly Accountable Entities (TFRS for NPAEs) promulgated by the Federation of Accounting Professions (FAP) during \\n2011. The adoption of these TFRS for NPAEs has resulted \\nin changes in the Institute’s accounting policies. The effects of those changes that have had a significant impact on the Institute’s financial statements are disclosed in note 4.\\nIn addition, the Institute has complied with Thai \\nFinancial Reporting Standard for Publicly Accountable Entities as follows:\\n    TFRS Topic\\n  TAS 7 (revised 2009)\\n Statement of Cash Flows\\nThe financial statements are prepared and presented \\nin Thai Baht, rounded in the notes to the financial statements to the nearest thousand. They are prepared \\non the historical cost basis except as stated in the \\naccounting policies.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity \\nwith TFRS for NPAEs requires management to make \\njudgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may \\ndiffer from estimates.Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \\nan ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.  \\nInformation about significant areas of estimation \\nuncertainty and critical judgements in applying \\naccounting policies that have the most significant effect \\non the amount recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes:\\nNote 3 Impact of severe flooding in Thailand\\nNote 11 Employee benefit obligations \\nNote 17 Contingent liabilities\\nFund accounting\\nTo ensure observance of limitations and restrictions \\nplaced on the use of the resources available to the Institute, the books of account of the Institute are \\nmaintained in accordance with the principles of “fund \\naccounting” which is appropriate for a non-profit organisation. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and \\nreporting purposes into funds, which are in accordance \\nwith activities or objects specified.

However, the consideration for \\nthis discount is that should the lease not be renewed and \\nthe land reverts to Thammasat University (University), so \\nall buildings and infrastructure on the Institute’s site will \\nbecome the property of the University.Furthermore, the Lease is contingent on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the University and the \\nInstitute. The MOU provides that the Institute will make \\navailable and fund a total of sixty scholarships over the thirty-\\nyear life of the Lease. Scholarships made in accordance with \\nthe MOU will cover tuition fees for qualified lecturers from the University, selected by the University, to pursue a Doctoral \\ndegree at the Institute.

Out of the three labour cases one has been \\nruled out by the Central Labour Court in favour of AIT and it \\nis still in process at the Supreme Court. The Central Labour \\nCourt made an appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the \\ntwo labour cases. The two student cases are still pending at \\nthe Provincial court. As at 31 December 2011, the provision \\nhas been set up for two labour cases. For other cases, the management believes that the outcome of all these cases will \\nbe in favour of the Institute and the ultimate outcome cannot \\nbe presently and reliably determined or quantified. Thus, no \\nliability is recorded in the accompanying financial statements \\nas at 31 December 2011.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/AIT_AnnualReport_2011.pdf', 'page': 148}),\n",

The celebrations were marked with an \\narray of events, with Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn \\ngracing the inauguration ceremony on the AIT campus on 24 October. \\nIn conjunction with celebrations, AIT honored distinguished alumni who \\nhave made contributions to society and to AIT, by inducting the second \\nbatch of AIT Hall of Famers. It was also equally befitting to have Professor \\nJoyce McConnell, President of AIT’s founding university, Colorado State \\nUniversity, deliver the keynote address at the event.\\nI was part of the first batch of students to graduate from AIT, and my \\nlife and career have been intertwined with that of the Institute itself. \\nTherefore, the 60th anniversary celebrations were very meaningful for \\nme personally, and I owe a great debt of gratitude to AIT for giving me a \\nscholarship for my Masters degree, the opportunity to study abroad for \\nmy doctoral studies, and a teaching career for many years. I subsequently \\nbecame a developer, investor, and businessman and had the opportunity \\nto re-engage with AIT as a Board member and later Chairman. Therefore, I \\nam indebted and have always strived to give back to AIT in whatever form \\nI can contribute.\\nThis is just my story, but there are similar success stories from among \\nour 24,000 alumni spread across more than 100 countries. One such \\nindividual is distinguished AIT alumnus and 2010 Hall of Fame inductee \\nDr. Tongchat Hongladaromp, who will be taking over the Chairmanship \\nof the Board from next year. Dr. Tongchat has had a stellar career in \\ngovernment and the private sector as well as academia, and I am \\nconfident that all of you will extend to him the same level of support I have \\nbeen fortunate to receive over the years.\\nI will be stepping down knowing that the future of AIT is looking very good \\nafter passing through so many challenges. As it charts its future course \\nunder the slogan “Transforming AIT,” the Institute remains committed to \\ncontributing to the development of Asia, and AIT President Dr. Eden Y. \\nWoon has already embarked on key strategies to take AIT to the next level \\nwith greater global recognition. \\nIn conclusion, I wish to once again thank all our Trustees and partners for \\ntheir strong and continued support to the Institute. \\nDr. Subin Pinkayan\\nChairman\\nBoard of Trustees\\nAsian Institute of Technology (AIT)\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/Annual-Report-2019.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AIT Annual Report 2019 | 3PRESIDENT’S  \\nMESSAGE\\nBy the time you get this Annual Report 2019, the world would be \\nembroiled in the COVID-19 Pandemic. But in the year of 2019, even \\nat year’s end, there was little hint of what was to come in 2020. At \\nAIT, it was the same. 2019 was a great year for AIT!. It was our 60th \\nAnniversary Year; and it was the first full year of the new AIT vision of \\nI2E2S2 (Innovation, Internationalisation, Enterprise, Entrepreneurship, \\nStakeholders, Support ). Therefore, our work in 2019 revolved around \\nthese two tasks—to celebrate our anniversary, and to put in place a \\nRoadmap for us to work towards our vision.  \\nOn the first task, an Organising Committee worked all year on disparate \\nevents which highlighted our anniversary, and on a gala week in late \\nOctober to formally celebrate our 60th Birthday.  All this was possible \\nbecause of the tremendous support of AIT Alumni in all the different \\ncountries.  Many of the alumni came home during the week of October \\n21 and spent four days going to the Gala Dinner, a Formal Ceremony \\npresided over by HRH Princess Sirindhorn, a Presidents’ Forum for \\ntwenty university presidents attending from all over the world, and a \\nHomecoming Day for all the alumni.  Details can be found inside this \\nReport.\\nFor the first time in AIT history, this Annual Report includes a Sustainability \\nReport , and it can be found in the Appendix . Also in this Report you will \\nfind the detailed work we did all year to get ourselves on the road to \\nTransforming AIT. Whether it is in introducing more innovation in our \\nresearch and in our course offerings, whether it is in re-establishing the \\nglobal footprint of AIT once again, in 2019 we made significant progress.  \\nWe also now have a new Vice President for Knowledge Transfer who \\noversaw our work in forging closer ties with the private sector, and to \\nhelp launch AIT’s very first Entrepreneurship Centre in September 2019.  \\nOn the vision of engaging more with stakeholders and supporters, we \\ndevoted a great deal of resources and time to improve student life and \\ncampus operations. We cultivated the alumni on a more regular and \\ndeeper basis, and we are making some inroads in bringing in donations \\nfor AIT.  As AIT moves smartly transforming itself, we would expect more \\ndonors to want to help us along that road.   \\nAll in all, 2019, our 60th Anniversary Year, was a good year for AIT. I hope \\nyou enjoy reading about our accomplishments and our events. Thank \\nyou very much for your support!  But as I said at the outset, when you \\nread this, the world will be in a different place. AIT, however, will go \\nforward “Without Missing a Beat”  with your support!\\nEden Y.

But all through AIT 1.0 and 2.0, \\nmany of AIT’s graduates spread out across the world and contrib -\\nuted to the social and economic development of many communi -\\nties, and the Institute’s research into social impact fields became \\nwell known. It is a fact that other academic institutions globally in \\nthe past two decades grew faster with more resources, exposing \\nthe critical need for AIT to be more competitive and more relevant.\\nThe I2E2S2 strategic focus has been incorporated in the new AIT \\nRoadmap, which underpins AIT 3.0. Following extensive delib -\\nerations, the leadership team, including deans, faculty, and sen -\\nior staff, put together the AIT Roadmap for the next three years \\n(2019-2021), which was acknowledged by the AIT Board of Trus -\\ntees at its 25 July 2019 meeting. “Transforming AIT” was the slo -\\ngan for the AIT 60th anniversary and key aspects of the strategy \\noutline how AIT is going to transform itself by embracing innova -\\ntion, being international, working with enterprises, nurturing en -\\ntrepreneurship, caring for stakeholders, and broadening support. \\nAIT research disciplines are critical to the societies of Asia, and \\nthe Institute will continue these studies but with more innovation; \\nthus the new motto for AIT is “Social Impact with Innovation.” VISION\\nTransforming AIT to be a \\nrespectable international \\ngraduate institution \\nwhose research and \\neducation contribute \\nto the development of \\nAsia, by making AIT more \\nglobal, more innovative, \\nmore entrepreneurial, \\nand more economically \\nrelevant--while leveraging \\non its social impact core \\nstrengths.

In addition, \\nthe financials were amended to reflect total revenue for spon -\\nsored programs, including research, training, and consulting. \\nThe Budget process was automated with a particular focus on \\nways to generate future additional revenue. Given the budget \\nchallenges faced during 2019, everyone across AIT played their \\npart in reducing or delaying expenses.   \\nMODERNIZING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO \\nTRANSFORM AIT\\nAn important element in the transformation of AIT is to review \\ncurrent policies and procedures to ensure that they are but flex -\\nible enough to support transformative initiatives and creativity. \\nThis remains an ongoing process, with practices and forms be -\\ning revised to ensure they follow best practice that are highly \\nefficient and effective.\\nORGANIZED SUCCESSFUL 60TH ANNIVERSARY \\nEVENTS ALL YEAR AS HIGHLIGHTED BY OCTOBER \\nCELEBRATIONS\\nAIT celebrated its 60th Anniversary in 2019, and organized a \\nnumber of activities throughout the year, culminating in very \\nsuccessful multi-event celebrations between 23 and 25 October \\n2019. These included a Thai-style gala dinner attended by over \\n700 participants, the main 60th anniversary ceremony, presided \\nover by HRH Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the Presidents \\nForum in which 16 University Presidents and Vice Chancellors \\nparticipated, and the AIT Alumni Open House. AIT was gener -\\nously supported through sponsorship of the VIP luncheon and \\nfree coffee. \\nORGANIZED FIRST-EVER AIT SENIOR LEADERSHIP \\nRETREAT FOR FACUL TY AND STAFF IN NOVEMBER\\nThe first all-Institute leadership retreat in some time was held \\nin November 2019, with 39 faculty, staff, and senior leadership \\ncoming together to explore a number of issues, all under the \\nmain topic of Social Impact with Innovation. It was a productive \\nretreat, where issues such as academic reform, student satisfac -\\ntion, financial challenges, operational processes, and out-of-the- \\nbox thinking on finances and partnerships were deliberated. It is worth mentioning that a welcome outcome of the retreat \\nwas getting to know people across AIT better, helping to break \\ndown the “silos” that exist in institutions. \\nCENTRALIZED RECRUITING AND MARKETING AND \\nPROMOTION ACTIVITIES LAUNCHED DECEMBER \\n2019\\nIn recognition of the fact that AIT generates most of its revenue \\nthrough tuition and fees, student recruitment activities are be -\\ning supported by a more focused marketing and promotion \\napproach. With this centralized approach, recruiting and mar -\\nketing will be more effectively delivered as well as much more \\ndeliberate in targeting applicants and countries to expand AIT’s \\nrecruiting efforts. \\nAIT further aimed to cultivate alumni relations more broadly and \\ndeeply to include lifelong learning opportunities, among other \\naims. To this end, the AIT Graduates Club was launched. \\nAn additional stakeholders strategy includes the AIT Interna -\\ntional School (AITIS), which remains integral to the recruitment \\nof both employees and students. Enrolment at AITIS continues \\nto grow, with parents being very supportive of the school and \\nindicating their desire to keep their children enrolled in AITIS \\nbeyond Grade 6. Challenges to doing so are being addressed \\nby the AIT leadership. \\nSupport  \\n(Fundraising)\\nThe Office of Advancement and Alumni Affairs (OAAA) continues \\nto initiate new partnerships with industry and the private sector \\nin order to provide the Institute with more opportunities for stu -\\ndent internships, tuition scholarships, and other forms of partner -\\nships with both local and multinational companies in Thailand \\nand overseas. The aim is also to secure fully-funded scholarships \\nat Masters and PhD levels from donor agencies that provide hu -\\nman resource development capacity-building to universities \\nthrough the respective Ministries in the Government. The OAAA \\nalso serves as the focal point for individual alumni, the AIT Alumni \\nAssociation (AITAA), and national chapters to provide support to \\nalumni and to develop collaboration and partnership for mutual \\nbenefit with focus on fundraising. \\nInternationalization is one of the key strategic priorities of AIT’s \\nRoadmap, and the Institute is working toward providing Masters \\nstudents with broader global opportunities such as through the \\nStudent Exchange Scholarship Program for their further develop -\\nment in order to become responsible citizens of the world. This \\nscholarship is for students exchanging one semester at top uni -\\nversities around the world with whom AIT has partnership agree -\\nments and meet half the total airfare, board, and lodging expens -\\nes of the student. \\nDuring the AIT’s 60th Anniversary Fundraising Campaign, the \\nsoft launch of the campaign took place in January 2019 based \\non the three critical needs of the Institute and its corresponding \\npriorities for fundraising.

       " Document(page_content='52 | AIT Annual Report 2019Independent Auditor’s Report\\nTo the Board of Trustees of Asian Institute of Technology\\nOpinion\\nI have audited the financial statements of Asian Institute of Technology (“Institute”), which comprise the statement of financial posi -\\ntion and statement of financial position classified by funds as at 31 December 2019, the statement of revenues and expenses, the \\nstatement of revenues and expenses classifies by funds, changes in fund balances and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes, \\ncomprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\\nIn my opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Institute as \\nat 31 December 2019 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Thai Financial \\nReporting Standard for Non-Publicly Accountable Entities (TFRS for NPAEs).\\nBasis for Opinion \\nI conducted my audit in accordance with Thai Standards on Auditing (TSAs). My responsibilities under those standards are further \\ndescribed in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the \\nInstitute in accordance with Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Federation of Accounting Professions that is \\nrelevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require -\\nments. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\nOther Information\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, \\nbut does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be made available to \\nme after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance conclusion \\nthereon. \\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it \\nbecomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or \\nmy knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nWhen I read the annual report, if I conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, I am required to communicate the matter to \\nthe management and request that the correction be made.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with TFRS for NPAEs, \\nand for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free \\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern, \\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management \\neither intends to liquidate the Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements \\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstate -\\nment, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of \\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with TSAs will always detect a material misstatement when \\nit exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reason -\\nably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/Annual-Report-2019.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

These \\nEnglish language financial statements have been prepared \\nfrom the Thai language statutory financial statements, and \\nwere approved and authorised for issue by the President of the \\nInstitute on 28 May 2020.\\n1. General information\\nThe Asian Institute of Technology, the “Institute”, is a regional \\npost-graduate institution. The Institute operates on a not-for-profit \\nbasis.  The Institute is located at the following addresses\\nThailand:  58 Moo 9 Km. 42 Paholyothin Highway, Klong Luang, \\nPathumthani, Thailand. \\nBranch: Building B3, University of Transport and Communica -\\ntions, Lang Thuong Ward, Dong Da Dist., Hanoi, Vietnam\\nThe principal activities of the Institute are providing programs in \\nengineering, science, advanced technologies and related man -\\nagement and administration.\\n2. Basis of preparation of the financial \\nstatements\\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with Thai Fi -\\nnancial Reporting Standard for Non-publicly Accountable Entities \\n(TFRS for NPAEs) and guidelines promulgated by the Federation \\nof Accounting Professions and the Institute’s accounting policy.\\nIn addition, the Institute has complied with Thai Financial Report -\\ning Standard for Publicly Accountable Entities as follows:\\n  TFRS Topic\\n  TAS 7  Statement of Cash Flows\\nThe financial statements are prepared and presented in Thai Baht, \\nrounded in the notes to the financial statements to the nearest \\nthousand unless otherwise stated. They are prepared on the his -\\ntorical cost basis except as stated in the accounting policies.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with TFRS \\nfor NPAEs requires management to make judgements, estimates \\nand assumptions that affect the application of the Company’s ac -\\ncounting policies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongo -\\ning basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised pro -\\nspectively.\\nTo ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on \\nthe use of the resources available to the Institute, the books of ac -\\ncount of the Institute are maintained and classified for account -\\ning and reporting purposes into funds, which are in accordance \\nwith activities or objects specified. Within each fund group, fund \\nbalances which are restricted by outside sources are so indicated \\nand are distinguished from unrestricted fund allocated to specific \\npurposes by action of the governing board. The governing board \\nretains full control of unrestricted funds to use in achieving insti -\\ntutional objectives. The purposes and objects of the funds are as follows:\\nUNRESTRICTED CURRENT FUND (FUND 10)\\nThis fund is the operating account of most of the academic and \\nadministrative units of the Institute.  It is available for general op -\\nerating purposes without restrictions, such as might be imposed \\nby a grant agency or donor.\\nUNRESTRICTED FUND-GENERAL (FUND 21)\\nThis fund is the operating account of support units that offer aca -\\ndemic-related services and certain administrative functions.\\nRESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND (FUND 22)\\nThe Endowment Fund is used where donors have stipulated, as \\na condition of their gift, either the principal is to be maintained \\ninviolate and in perpetuity or used along with the income to meet \\nthe objectives of the endowment. \\nRESTRICTED PROGRAM FUND (FUND 30 AND FUND 31)\\nThe program fund includes academic and non-academic pro -\\ngrams. Non-academic programs is subject to restrictions by \\ndonors or other agencies limiting its use for funding specific re -\\nsearch projects, conference, short courses, workshops or similar \\nprojects.\\nUNRESTRICTED FUND-INTEGRATED FACILITY \\nMANAGEMENT (FUND 24)\\nThis fund includes the operating account of the Institute for as -\\nset maintenance and for the provision of the Institute’s non-core \\noperations, mainly on integrated facilities management service.\\nRESTRICTED FUND-GENERAL RESERVE (FUND 23)\\nThe annual surplus of the unrestricted funds and the excess of \\nthe activities under Sponsored Program fund that were complet -\\ned during the year, are transferred to the General Reserve each \\nyear.

The Institute \\nhas no title to these funds and the associated revenues and ex -\\npenses have been excluded from the statement of revenues and \\nexpenses.  The assets held on behalf of these others have been \\ndisclosed in the statement of financial position together with the \\nassociated liability for the same amount to these other parties.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/Annual-Report-2019.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='AIT Annual Report 2019 | 61\\nAPPENDICES3. Significant accounting policies\\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consist -\\nently to all periods presented in these financial statements.\\n(A) BASIS OF PREPARATION\\nThe financial statements of the Institute comprise the funds of the \\nInstitute and those of its branch to which it holds title. \\nThe Branch is an autonomous or semi-autonomous operating en -\\ntity within an organisation which does not have a separate legal \\nidentity. The Branch has separately identifiable assets, liabilities, \\ncash flows, revenues and expenses over which it has account -\\nability.\\n(B) FOREIGN CURRENCIES TRANSACTIONS\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into Thai Baht at \\nthe foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies \\nat the reporting date are translated to Thai Baht at the foreign ex -\\nchange rates at that date. Gains or losses arising on translation are \\nrecognised in the statement of revenues and expenses.\\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency \\ntransactions are measured at cost in foreign currencies are trans -\\nlated to Thai Baht at the exchange rates at the dates of the trans -\\nactions.\\nForeign branch\\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign branch are translated to Thai \\nBaht at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.\\nThe revenues and expenses of foreign branch are translated to \\nThai Baht at rates approximating the foreign exchange rates rul -\\ning at the dates of the transactions.\\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recog -\\nnised in the statement of revenues and expenses.\\n(C) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits \\nand highly liquid short-term investments.\\n(D) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES\\nAccounts receivable are stated at their invoice value less allow -\\nance for doubtful accounts.\\nReceivables from Program fund are unbilled receivables repre -\\nsented amount expected to be collected from donors.\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for inactive stu -\\ndents. Bad debts are written off when incurred.\\nBad debts recovered are recognised in other income in the state -\\nment of revenues and expenses.\\n(E) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\nOwned assets\\nProperty and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and losses on decline in value.Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the ac -\\nquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes \\nthe cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly at -\\ntributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their \\nintended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items \\nand restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised \\nborrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to the func -\\ntionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that \\nequipment.\\nDonated assets are stated at cost or reasonable market price as \\ndeemed cost. Subsequently they are stated at cost less accumu -\\nlated depreciation.\\nWhen parts of an item of property and equipment have different \\nuseful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major com -\\nponents) of property and equipment. \\nAny gains and losses on disposal of an item of property and \\nequipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from dis -\\nposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment, and \\nare recognised net within other income in the statements of rev -\\nenues and expenses.\\nSubsequent costs\\nThe cost of replacing a part of an item of property and equipment \\nis recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable \\nthat the future economic benefits embodied within the part will \\nflow to the Institute, and its cost can be measured reliably. The \\ncarrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs \\nof the day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recog -\\nnised in the statements of revenues and expenses as incurred.\\nDepreciation\\nDepreciation is calculated based on the depreciable amount \\nwhich excludes freehold land and assets under construction, \\nwhich is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, \\nless its residual value. \\nDepreciation is charged to the statement of revenues and ex -\\npenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of \\neach component of an item of property and equipment.

Scholarships made in accordance with the MOU will \\ncover tuition fees for qualified lecturers from the University, select -\\ned by the University, to pursue a Doctoral degree at the Institute. \\nAt 31 December 2019, the scholarship commitment amounted to \\ntotaling Baht 76.5 million (2018: Baht 76.5 million).    \\nSERVICE AGREEMENT\\nThe Institute has entered into service agreements with various \\ncompanies, some of which had expired in 2019 and beginning \\nof 2020. Therefore, the Institute has entered into new agree -\\nments with the previous parties to receive various services and \\nare obligated to pay service fees at the rates specified in the new \\nagreements. The agreements can be extended by notifying in \\nwriting before the end of the original contract period which are \\nspecified in the agreements.primarily due to the impact from the amended Labor Protection \\nAct (on 5 April 2019) which requires an employer to provide an \\nadditional severance payment to a terminated employee.

We were all \\nlooking bullishly towards 2020, a year \\nwhen we thought Transforming AIT \\ncould truly move smartly forward.\\nUnfortunately, no sooner than 2020 \\nbegan, the COVID-19 pandemic hit \\nthe world, including Thailand, in \\nJanuary.  What followed was a whole \\nyear of battling against the coronavirus, \\nkeeping the campus safe, and carrying \\non our usual quality education and \\nresearch under trying circumstances, \\nwhile at the same time Transforming \\nAIT. This was no easy task, but AIT \\npulled together and went through \\n2020 successfully, with recruitment on \\ntrack and accomplishments plentiful. \\nOur lockdown measures were strictly \\nadhered to, and we recorded not \\na single case of COVID-19 in our \\ncommunity in 2020. We were able to set \\nup, with the approval of the Government of Thailand, an Organizational \\nQuarantine facility on campus to house \\nour incoming overseas students and \\nbring them steadily into Thailand. \\nThanks to generous donors—including \\nmany alumni, we created Smart \\nModified Classrooms to engage in \\nHybrid Instruction teaching for all of the \\nAugust 2020 semester, literally “without \\nmissing a beat” in AIT education. \\nWe improvised on research so that \\nstudents still completed their projects/\\ntheses and graduated on time.\\nThe pandemic lasted a whole year, and \\nexperts tell us it will be with us for some \\ntime. But as you can see in this Annual \\nReport, the AIT community of faculty, \\nstaff, and students—with supporters \\nlike our alumni and our Board of Trus -\\ntees—were still very active in this pan -\\ndemic year of 2020 and also achieved \\nsome notable milestones.

AIT Enterprises Alliance\\nThe AIT Enterprises Alliance will pur -\\nsue more research contracts and col -\\nlaborations with enterprises, develop \\nprograms desired by industry, involve \\npractitioners from enterprises in AIT \\neducation, solicit internships, coopera -\\ntions, and job placement with industry, \\nand be known as economically relevant \\nto the community by applying new \\nknowledge derived from AIT to help \\nbusinesses in Thailand and the region.\\n2. Minors\\nIn addition to the academic program \\nstudents are enrolled in, they can join a minor in another academic program \\nby taking their 12 credits of designated \\ncourses.\\n3. Exchanges\\n12-credit international exchanges are \\nmeant to provide AIT students with an \\nopportunity to learn inside and outside \\nthe classroom in a partner university. \\nA positive exchange experience offers \\nstudents an opportunity to cultivate \\nacademic knowledge, transversal \\nskills, and intercultural communication \\nand to expand their personal and pro -\\nfessional network.\\n4. Internships\\n12-credit internships provide students \\nwith an opportunity to apply theories \\nand skills learned in the classroom \\nin a professional environment. The \\ninternship consists of project- or re -\\nsearch-based assignments, not rou -\\ntine tasks of the hosting organization, \\nand it should relate to the student’s \\nacademic program. The internship can \\ntake place at the hosting organization. \\nThe period of internship should be at least 480 hours over a minimum of 3 \\nmonths. The hosting organization and \\nthe AIT faculty advisor, who will co-su -\\npervise the internship, must agree on \\nthe internship assignment.\\n5. Service Learning\\nService Learning provides students \\nwith an opportunity to work on a com -\\nmunity-based assignment at an actual \\nlocation to gain valuable practical ex -\\nperience. The period of community-\\nbased service should be at least 480 \\nhours over a minimum of 3 months and \\nit is equivalent to 12 credits toward \\nMaster program credit requirements.\\n 6.

Under the \\nguidance of the Vice President for Aca -\\ndemic Affairs, a Task Force of 7 mem -\\nbers was formed to review the Admis -\\nsions System further. Opinions were \\ngathered from the Members, and an \\nanonymous survey of 3 sets of stake -\\nholders (Faculty, Staff, Students) was \\ncarried out. A total of 59 different input \\nitems were recorded, and a series of \\nface-to-face meetings were held in ad -\\ndition to online email communications \\namong the Members. The Task Force \\ncategorized all items into three lev -\\nels—Systemic, Operational, and Proce -\\ndural—and discussed individual items \\nfor possible solutions. The Task Force \\nalso discussed whether radical change \\n(e.g., outsourcing Admissions or hav -\\ning Customers Relations Management \\nsystem put in place) could be consid -\\nered but decided to remedy the cur -\\nrent weaknesses identified through the \\nsurvey. Based on the inputs, the Task \\nForce reviewed and revised as neces -\\nsary admissions-related documents \\n(offer letters and other accompanying \\ndocuments) used to communicate with \\nstudents at the various stages of the ad -\\nmissions process. It was recommended \\nto include an integrated chat feature in \\nthe online application system for each applicant. This feature would have to \\noffer real-time communication and in -\\nteraction both with the applicant and \\nthe concerned schools or units (Aca -\\ndemic Program Chairs and staff, Depart -\\nment Heads, School Deans, Language \\nCenter, and Admissions) to avoid any \\ncommunication gap. The Task Force \\nalso recommended including a chat \\nfeature on the main AIT website.\\nA revised staff performance evalua -\\ntion was approved for implementation \\nin late 2020, with its main focus being \\ndevelopmental in nature combined \\nwith recognition of performance. The \\naim of the new performance evaluation \\nwas to increase engagement from su -\\npervisors and employees, focusing on \\nperformance, employee development, \\nand the setting of measurable goals. \\nA new tool was developed, and sup -\\nporting guidelines and examples were \\nprovided.\\nThe review of Policies and Procedures \\n(P&P) continued, with changes being \\nmade to almost 20% of all statements \\ncompleted in 2020. All Facilities and Ser -\\nvices Affairs P&Ps have been reviewed, \\nas have more than half (56%) of Financial \\nand Business Affairs P&Ps. Review of the remaining P&Ps, mainly for Academic \\nAdministrative Affairs and Personnel Af -\\nfairs, are underway and aim to be com -\\npleted before Summer 2021.\\nAlthough progress was made with cam -\\npus reforms, COVID-19 delayed a num -\\nber of initiatives, with AIT being hesitant \\nto invite external contractors onto the \\ncampus. Notwithstanding this, renova -\\ntions were made to student dormitories, \\ninitial discussions were held on a physi -\\ncal campus master plan, and a number \\nof vendors made proposals regarding \\ninitiatives for a future sustainable green \\nAIT campus.\\nBy the end of 2020, 110 student accom -\\nmodation units had been upgraded, \\nadding air-conditioning units in each \\nindividual room and communal areas \\nwhere applicable as well as hot water \\nunits in bathrooms. Initial physical cam -\\npus zones were contemplated, with \\na final report to be proposed in 2021. \\nAlthough COVID-19 delayed many in -\\nfrastructure initiatives, proposals were \\nreceived regarding erecting solar panels \\naround the campus. A final decision was \\npostponed to 2021 to allow AIT to incor -\\nporate these decisions into the long-term \\nfuture AIT Campus Master Plan.25 \\nTRANSFORMING AIT INITIATIVES', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/ANNUAL-REPORT-2020.-AIT.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='52 \\nAIT ANNUAL REPORT 2020\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\\nTo the Board of Trustees of Asian Institute of Technology\\nOpinion\\nI have audited the financial statements of Asian Institute of Technology (“Institute”), which comprise the statement of financial \\nposition and statement of financial position classified by funds as at 31 December 2020, the statement of revenues and \\nexpenses, the statement of revenues and expenses classifies by funds, changes in fund balances and cash flows for the year \\nthen ended, and notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\\nIn my opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \\nInstitute as at 31 December 2020 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with \\nthe Thai Financial Reporting Standard for Non-Publicly Accountable Entities (TFRS for NPAEs).\\nBasis for Opinion \\nI conducted my audit in accordance with Thai Standards on Auditing (TSAs). My responsibilities under those standards \\nare further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am \\nindependent of the Institute in accordance with Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Federation \\nof Accounting Professions that is relevant to my audit of the financial statements, and I have fulfilled my other ethical \\nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and \\nappropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\\nOther Information\\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual \\nreport, but does not include the financial statements and my auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be \\nmade available to me after the date of this auditor’s report. \\nMy opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I will not express any form of assurance \\nconclusion thereon. \\nIn connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information identified above \\nwhen it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the \\nfinancial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. \\nWhen I read the annual report, if I conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, I am required to communicate the \\nmatter to the management and request that the correction be made.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with TFRS \\nfor NPAEs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial \\nstatements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Institute’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless \\nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements \\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material \\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance \\nis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with TSAs will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \\nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of \\nthese financial statements.', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/ANNUAL-REPORT-2020.-AIT.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='53 \\nAPPENDICES | INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with TSAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout \\nthe audit. I also: \\n  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design \\nand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to \\nprovide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \\none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the over -\\nride of internal control. \\n  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropri -\\nate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Institute’s internal \\ncontrol.\\n  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \\ndisclosures made by management. \\n  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the \\naudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant \\ndoubt on the Institute’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am re -\\nquired to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures \\nare inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my \\nauditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Institute to cease to continue as a going concern. \\n  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and \\nwhether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presen -\\ntation. \\nI communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant \\naudit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\\n(Yuvanuch Thepsongvaj) \\nCertified Public Accountant \\nRegistration No. 5371\\nKPMG Phoomchai Audit Ltd. \\nBangkok \\n27 May 2021\\n', metadata={'source': './docs/ait_pdf/ANNUAL-REPORT-2020.-AIT.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",
